Some small relief finds you as she extends herself further within you and squirts large volume of her slime into your lower intestine. The main mass of the parasite moves deeper into you while the tips of her tendrils are felt poking out of her. Even though she moves, her ass-like orifice still sticks out of your own asshole.

Groans leak from your mouth when the female parasite pushes what you’ve assumed to be her egg further up your rectum.
