			//Decidedly 3rd in the range of original items available at The Entite. The only thing this does is give you weird dreams and some lust but it’s main reason for being is vaguely plot related. Having two within a short time frame leads to a bad end.

			//Effects/Guaranteed
			//100% of occurring.
			//Player gains status effect ‘Woozy’.
			//‘Woozy’ increases lust to max, reduces Aim by 10 and increases Int by 10 for its duration and gives Blue Balls status effect if applicable.
			//Woozy lasts for 4 hours or until the PC sleeps, whichever comes first.
			//When the PC falls asleep under the Woozy effect, trigger different ‘trips’ and an orgasm event.
			//Taking two Wiff-O-Wisp within the 4 hour time period results in an unpleasant bad end.


			//Consumption
			//Wiff-O-Wisp can be used anywhere like normal consumables and will apply the ‘Woozy’ effect. Nothing truly happens until the PC goes to sleep.
