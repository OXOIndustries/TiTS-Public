	/**
	 * Feline transformative.
	 * 
	 * Have 2 layers of effects. At first, basic layer it is cosmetic transformative, granting "little kitty" appearance, lean and androgynous.
	 * 
	 * Second layer is "legacy code" from another transformative used as base. It is only accessible with improper bypass of nanobots safety protocols with not-actually-compatible control device. It grants cat-taur body, but much more practical than most tauric forms, with workarounds for most drawbacks of taur body. Based on chakat, but not exactly.
	 * 
	 * Legacy body features (some can be lore-only, it is not original transformative after all):
	 *   Quadripedal taur with semi-prehensile forelegs (technically, forelegs should be considered plantigrade with extra joint, but this would be overcomplication). Pawpads (on all 6 limbs) are soft and sensitive, but very tough.
	 *   All are herms (for more effecient reproduction) with internal balls and genital slit (for protection of vulnerable organs).
	 *   Very, very flexible - not exactly at snake level, but can rival any other mammal (mostly lore feat, but makes possible to wave away some "how the fuck taur can do this").
	 *   Neat musclemass and tone balance - they are strong, but they are first of all sentients, so physique was considered secondary stat for them during development.
	 *   Long and prehensile tongue (one more limb? handy!).
	 *   Long and prehensile tail (same reason).
	 *   Note about lactation: they are mammals by all means, but leaking precious nutrients all the time is barely a viable survival strategy. Also, having extra useless weight on chest is not very practical too. They have naturally flat chest unless lactating, and their lactation is easily induced just by prolonged enough nipples stimulation, so anyone can feed a baby when have to, and quickly subsides (not hardlocked though, player can grow breasts by any other way). Possible option - lactation is vanae-like, permanent, but without need to be milked regulary.
	 *   Lifespan 150-200 years without modern medicine, but this is purposive flaw to stimulate maintaining high technological level, since their lifespan with proper medicine is essentially unlimited, especially with help of cybernetic surgery, which can  improve "autonomous time" up to millenias.
	 *   Designed to be totally fine without clothes in most but harshest environments, so they have predisposition to nudism, but not to exhibitionism, nakedness itself just doesn't matter for them.
	 *   Have no hair, only fur on head.
	 * 
	 * Neural system specifics (mostly lore only):
	 *   Special racial feature: Mental Equilibrium. This is one of the "frontier species", and, as well as other of type, has it's attempt to create more stable community.
	 *   Very friendly (unless abused - they are far from being pacificts).
	 *   Highly resistant to drugs and poisons, including mind-affecting (maybe even to point of rejecting bimbofication drugs which would work for other races).
	 *   Have semi-electrical nervous system rather than fully chemical, so their reflexes are on par with ones of syntethics.
	 * 
	 * Possible gameplay effects:
	 *   Can't have personality score above 60 (being assholes without good reason is nearly physically painful for them).
	 *   Libido gain/loss bonus/penalty pushing towards 30 (friendly in all ways, but not to the point when it becomes problem).
	 *   Imbibing alcohol restores their energy without getting drunk (though would requre branch for all related scenes, but this could be not only one alcohol immune race).
	 *   Bonus to chemical-based lust damage resistance (pheromones and drugs), penalty to tease damage resistance, being damaged by foe reduces lust notably and grants stacking tease resistance until combat end (have hard times resisting pure teasers, but being physically attacked turns off greatly).
	 *   Exhibitionism is hardlocked on "don't care" as long as genitals have specific configuration.
	 *   Perk idea: Natural Armor. Can be shared with other races with tough natural defence. Resistance bonus to thermal damage (freeze/burn). Immune to effects of moderately harsh climate (on level with natives), and their pelts are unlikely to be damaged by minor enveiromental hazards (like Mhen'ga's spiked weeds).
	 *   Perk idea: Flexibility. Pretty much self explaining. Possibly scene variants. Possibly minor bonus to avoid attacks. Can be shared with other races, like Naleen.
