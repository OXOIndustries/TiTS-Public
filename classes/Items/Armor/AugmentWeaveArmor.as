The Cyber Punks of Zheng Shi are the most well-known users of this armor, employing variants that are designed to connect with and augment their own cybernetic implants.\n\nThe suit’s microbots could even interface with your immune-boosting microsurgeons, boosting your ability to recover from injury more rapidly. (+50% rest and sleep recovery.)";
