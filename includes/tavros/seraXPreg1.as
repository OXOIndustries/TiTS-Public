Notes

•	Put [Breed?] option in her talk menu. Choose it and she’ll say she obviously takes contraceptive, doesn’t want paternity suits/brat running around her shop etc. Can’t change her mind about it unless you successfully complete Sex Party.

•	If successful Sex Party, she’s on a reasonably secure financial footing (and the relationship’s advanced a bit) so she’s willing to knock you up.

•	She actually has only one vaginal fuck in her pool, on review. Will cook up another to support this.

•	Normal human gestation. Kid can be either sex and probably gains one or two hereditary traits, e.g. has horns, purple skin, is a complete brat.

•	Once you’ve popped the sprog Sera can occasionally be found in the nursery (in her casual attire, thank you) during the evening, watching her progeny play. N-not that she cares, of course.
