It’s a miracle I wasn’t kicked out of my house after that argument... v-very hateful things were said that I would rather not repeat... I did the only thing that I could think to do after that; which was to call my brother and sister. I told them about the argument and about my interest in tech. Thankfully, they were really understanding of the situation I was in.

Let’s split up and look then. It might make things a bit faster that way, yes?”</i>");

You try your best not to distract yourself too much from the wide array of electronics and look out for the things Fisianna mentioned that she needed.

The dragoness doesn’t look fazed by him at all, since she is still wearing the same warm smile as when she first appeared. She does however step up closer to the man. Britannia then places her face so close to his that they are almost touching. The dragon-morph abruptly blows a puff a smoke through her nostrils that makes the human stagger back coughing. Her facial expression suddenly changes from that warm smile to an extremely, terrifyingly stern face.");

It looks like it works! The human and ausar look on in terror at the imposing dragoness standing up to them.");

Whatever it is, it is vibrating more intensely than your body is. You also feel a faint warmness on your neck that comes and passes about every few seconds. You crane your neck down your body and find that Fisianna’s pawed arm is wrapped around your torso. You can also see parts of her animalistic right leg are wrapped over your [pc.legsNoun]. You turn your head right only to have your nose booped by a flicking feline ear. Fisianna’s head is nestled into your neck as she is snoring and purring peacefully.

You do your best to not to become aroused while the neko’s pajamas start to become moist against you. When you’re near your breaking point, you decide it would be best to wake the sleeping catgirl and snap her out of her lustful dream before any of the other girls have a chance to catch on.

When her tired eyes quickly snap open in shock and surprise, she quietly gasps. The distraught catgirl quickly releases you and shifts back to the other side of the bed, burying her head into the pillow. Through the pillow you can hear Fisianna shoot muffled apologies to you, but she is too afraid to show her face after her indelicate display. The best you can do is whisper back that everything is fine, that she doesn’t have to worry about it and that you won’t mention what happened to anyone. When you have convinced her enough, she raises her head out of her pillow to show you her beet red face. You give her your most sincere smile to ease her feelings of embarrassment.

You take up Fisianna’s offer for a date to the arcade and grab her paw in your hand as you both rise from the bench and head to the elevator shafts.");

We could play some CoV 8 if you wanted to, or Castle Mania, or anything else you have in mind. I’m up for anything!”</i> Fisianna smiles gleefully at you.");

In a corner of the arcade, you spot a number of games that look remarkably similar to games you would find at a terran carnival, complete with prizes. You point at the section with the carnival-like activities to Fisianna and ask if she would like to try her hand at playing those for now.");

	output("\n\nThe first activity that catches Fisianna’s eye is a <i>“Shoot the Target”</i> game. It looks pretty standard from what you can see. There are several red targets moving along a track, which can be shot down with what looks like a light gun about the size of a small rifle. A side display shows the prizes that can be won for hitting a certain amount of targets. One of the prizes catches Fisianna’s eye and she smooshes her face on the glass panel to try to find a better view of the item she is fawning over. It looks like an oversized stuffed cat that is mostly white in color with splotches of brown and black all over it. Once she is done examining the stuffed toy, she runs over to you and grabs your hands, giving you a pleading look. <i>“Please, please, please! Can you try to win me that cute stuffed cat? I’m not the best of shots and I’d <b>love</b> to have it back at my apartment!”</i>");
	output("\n\nSeeing no reason to refuse, you grant Fisianna’s request. You offer to pay for your tries at the targets, and once you swipe your credit chit past the receiver, the game springs to life. Three red targets move in a uniform line at a steady pace. You pick up a light gun, and a display shows that you have three chances to down the targets. You look towards the prize display to check how many shots you would need to win the cat. To your dismay, you find that will need to hit all three shots to be able to obtain that prize. Well... the pressure is on now!");
	output("\n\nAfter shaking off some nerves, you line up your shot and track one of the targets on your light rifle’s scope. It takes a few moments of careful aiming and adjusting before you make the attempt. Your first shot hits home, striking the target dead on. It falls backwards and out of sight as the display indicators flicker in response to your successful try. Fisianna whispers a near silent, <i>“yes!”</i> She smiles and waits for you to align your second shot.");
	output("\n\nAs you line up your second shot, you are beginning to think that this won’t be so hard after all, when to your chagrin, the targets begin to accelerate progressively faster. You silently curse your luck for underestimating the game and readjust your timing to the now increased pace of the targets’ movements. Once you have the timing down, you take your chance to fire at a carefully predicted spot where the two targets meet each other. You manage to hit the side of one of the intercepting targets, which folds over out of sight. Fisianna nods her head in approval, though she looks very nervous for you as she watches you ready up your third shot with bated breath.");
	output("\n\nYou take your aim at the last remaining target, which is moving at the same fast pace as before. You opt not to take the shot yet to watch for any changes in movement. Sure enough, the target starts to fluctuate in speed now. It is moving in very irregular patterns; sometimes moving blisteringly fast, other times tantalizingly slow. It even stalls to a standstill on occasion. It looks almost impossible to predict any sort of set pattern to take an easier shot on the lone target. Sighing, you take a deep breath to relax and train your sight on the target as best as you can, waiting for the moment when it slows down to a crawl. You hold your breath just as the target finally slows down enough to take aim at it. Taking the opportunity, you fire at it as soon as your crosshairs have it dead center on sight. At the moment you fire, the target jerks back to full speed, making you wonder for a split second if you hit it before the target just as abruptly stops again. You see that the target has a mark at the very edge of it, indicating a confirmed hit. The target folds back behind the line and out of sight, after which the prize panel lights up with a bright fanfare, declaring your victory. Fisianna rushes over to you and gives you a surprisingly crushing hug for someone of her small stature.");
	output("\n\n<i>“You did it! You really did it! I was so nervous for you, but you did it! You’re the best, [pc.name]!”</i> Fisianna looks into your eyes with joy written all over her face while her tails are wiggling a mile a minute behind her.");
	output("\n\nAfter Fisianna lets you go, you triumphantly [pc.walk] over to the prize panel and pick out the stuffed cat Fisianna wanted. After it drops into the nearby receptacle, you hand the plushie over to her. She hugs her new toy and sets it aside on a nearby table before wrapping her arms around you again.");

They even have artificial sky effects that work in real time as well! I hear it feels just like being outside.”</i>");

I even brought a picnic set complete with snacks and drinks for the day!”</i> Fisianna smiles cutely. She already seems to have everything planned out so you aren’t one to say otherwise. You agree to go check out the new park, to which the excited feline jumps out of her seat with joy.");

	output("\n\nThe elevator ride takes you quite a ways upward and it takes about a minute before you finally arrive at the Park deck. Once outside, you find that the entryway is fairly crowded. You assume it is so packed here because there isn’t a great deal of nature to interact with on Tavros. ");
	output("\n\nThe park is just about as Fisianna described it earlier, and quite accurately too. A gentle, warm breeze flows through the air under an artificial blue sky that looks convincingly real. There is an artificial sun that generates a warm glow over the park. Green fields and shrubberies dotted with wildflowers fill the landscape, along with the occasional pond and small waterfalls. Surprisingly, the park looks devoid of wildlife. You remark to Fisianna as such.");
	output("\n\n<i>“Ah. I imagine it’s because since the park is so new, they just haven’t been able to gather the necessary wildlife together yet. They would have to be careful picking what wildlife to place here so that they don’t wind up wreaking havoc on the ecosystem, or make it hard for whoever maintains all of this.”</i> Fisianna shrugs. <i>“Anyways, I figure we have a good amount of time to kill. Let’s check out what’s beyond and walk around for a bit!”</i> Fisianna wraps your arm around hers with her free arm.");
	output("\n\nThe two of you disperse from the crowd by the elevator and make your way down to a walkway that leads to a forested area. Along the way, you see a number of occupied benches surrounding various small ponds. The bodies of water are so crystal clear that it looks almost good enough to drink from directly. Their surfaces reflect the sky as ripples flow from the central fountains. There are already quite a lot of people laying on the fields setting up their own picnics, with children running in between each camped out group. ");
	output("\n\nAs the two of you walk further down the pathway and into the forested area, you see less people walking the same route. The ground becomes hilly as you start to hear the artificial sounds of birds chirping around you; it looks they at least thought of a temporary fix for the lack of wildlife. Fisianna pulls on your arm gently and leads you off of the walkway onto a dirt path. While walking on the earthy pathway, you notice that there are various trees with holographic markers to prevent anyone from losing their way. You lean out and touch one of the trees with a free arm and sure enough, it feels like the real deal.");
	output("\n\nThe two of you keep walking down the path until you come to a mid-sized clearing that is remarkably devoid of passersby.");

We can keep going afterwards, but for now I’m getting pretty hungry from smelling this food the whole entire way...”</i> Fisianna takes the cloth off of the picnic basket she is holding and lays it across the grass. She then places a number of containers full of different types of foods and snacks on one side of the mat. When you sit down next to her, she hands you two bottles of liquids. One of them feels quite warm to the touch, while the other is refreshingly cold.");
	output("\n\n<i>“I wasn’t so sure which you would like, so I made a yokto milkshake in the cold one, and in the hot one, some hot apple and cinnamon tea. I-I hope you like them.”</i> Fisianna blushes while she takes out the rest of the contents of the basket. You take a small sip of the yokto shake and find that it has a sourness somewhere between an orange and a lemon in intensity, but it has a flavor similar to blueberries. You can also taste bit of vanilla, which complements the flavor very well. You look towards the food containers nearby and find that are largely filled with sandwiches of different varieties. There are also a few containers filled salad, soup, and crackers to go with them.");
	output("\n\n<i>“Wow, Fisi. You really went all out!”</i> You say in amazement. She brought quite the smorgasbord of foods with her. Fisianna smiles in delight at your compliment.");

After the two of you finish your food, you relax in each other’s arms while you both sip away at your teas, fully sated from all of the food. Fisianna looks cutely into your eyes at one point and you can’t help but lean down and give her a peck on her lips. She seizes the opportunity to wrap her arms around the back of your head when you break the kiss. Her ears flatten backwards and her eyelids lower into the most adorable golden bedroom eyes you think you have ever seen.");

As she presses into you harder, her tongue begins to prod at your mouth. You part your lips only slightly and she takes full advantage, slipping the oral muscle into the opening. Your tongue rises up to meet hers before they play a frenetic dance inside of your cheeks. ");
	output("\n\nIn the heat of the moment, you shift your weight and roll around on the mat, pinning Fisianna beneath you. She separates her lips from you to gasp at the sudden change in position, but you give her no further time to react as you quickly lean in and resume your oral play. Using the opportunity from your lover’s brief pant for air, you slip your tongue into her mouth, searching for hers. She meets yours eventually, and when your tongues begin flicking and flailing against one another, she begins to purr. The vibrations of her body under you stimulates and massages your front side in a very relaxing manner. She presses her body into you, arching her back off of the ground. You take advantage by slipping your arms underneath her, cradling her while her purring intensifies. Her paws slide around your torso in response and her feline legs wrap around your [pc.legsNoun]. The neko sensuously moans into your mouth as you lay entwined with her. After a seemingly long while, Fisianna finally breaks the kiss, looking totally winded and disheveled. You lay to the side of her to catch your own breath.");

When you finish, the two of you continue down the dirt path on the other side of the clearing, pointing out different exotic looking flowers and trees along the way. You start to meet more people walking along the same path as the trail beneath you starts to become smoother. Eventually you reach the paved walkways again and follow them out of the forest. In the distance you can see the elevator shafts; the only artificial thing that breaks the natural landscape of the park. You and Fisianna walk arm in arm while you head back towards the elevator shafts.");

A few holo-posters that you didn’t see when you first arrived catch your attention as you make your way over. The poster that you look at in particular has an announcement that there will be an all-day outdoor movie night event coming soon. You make a mental note of it as a potential date idea for your next outing.

	output("\n\n<i>“Oh! That sounds like a great idea!”</i> Fisianna smiles widely. <i>“It’s nice that it is supposed to air all day so we don’t have to rush. I’ll go home really quickly and get some things ready for us then. I can’t wait!”</i> Fisianna gives you a quick peck on the cheek as she stands up from her seat on the bench. <i>“I’ll meet you by the elevators in about fifteen minutes, ok?”</i> You nod in agreement and watch her walk off towards her home.

The sky looks to be set to a permanent night time setting for the day, so artificial stars glimmer in a dark purple and black sky. The artificial sun is replaced by dimly glowing moon, which casts a soft light bright enough to be able to see in a non-sheltered area. At one end of the nearest clearing you can see a humongous holo screen. There is a massive amount of people camped out in front of the screen watching the previews, or otherwise snacking and talking amongst themselves. You can see Fisianna gazing at the scene in amazement, ears twitching and swiveling every which way as her golden eyes glitter in the artificial moonlight.");

Thinking of which, you actually have no idea which movie is going to be airing right at this moment.

You shrug the shoulder that Fisianna is not resting on and tell her that you don’t have the faintest idea yourself.");

The ship lands and the scavenging crew gathers everything they can reuse. The operation goes smoothly enough and the crew heads back to the ship, though there are subtle undertones of mystery as an unidentified figure flashes across the screen and into the vessel just as the door is closing. Fisianna grips onto you tighter as this happens. The title screen comes up afterwards, reading: “<i>The Intruder.</i>“ You start to feel a bit of dread yourself as you are beginning to think that this movie may not be the most pleasant of movies to watch on a date.");

Things grow even more bleak when several members of the search party go missing and only bloodstains are found.

You can hear Fisianna gasp in terror as a shadow forms behind the hapless crew member. The officer notices a little too late and comes face to face with the grotesque alien that stowed away on the ship. He screams and manages to fire only a few shots off from his pistol before the alien comes down on him. Fisianna buries her head into your shoulder and shakes in fright.
