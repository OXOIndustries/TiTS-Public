The feeling is mutual, as siel note humans resemble a 'Yorri', one of their native humanoid animals.\n\nStarting at the top, siel have a pair of antennae poking out of the front top of their head that sweep backwards. Like the rest of their body, the antennae are a bluish grey. Their hair varies from dark or light blues, purples, or pinks, as well as black or white. It can be of any length.\n\nSiel have incredibly vibrant eyes that easily stand out. The outer ring of their iris is typically black, while the inner portion is a bright blue, purple, or pink. The way the color bleeds out makes their eyes look like eclipsing stars.\n\nAt their necks are thin, horizontal slits. These are a pair of otherwise unassuming gills used for breathing when air to the mouth is cut off.\n\nThe chest portion of a siel is similar to that of humans - breasts on women varying generally from A to D cups, and flat male chests. Their stomachs, however, have segmented muscles much like that of a caterpillar, broken up into square-like sections.\n\nAlong their sides and starting level with the solar plexus are two rows of spikey, single jointed pro-legs, widely spaced apart. When pressed flush to the skin these appear to be small, v-shaped 'armor chinks'. However, when pulled away they appear similar to the tiny legs of a centipede - an appearance some races find unnerving.\n\nFrom a front angle, siel look as if they have unusually chunky hips, legs, and thighs with knees and two split toes. However, from behind it is obvious that their body continues on into a long caterpillar-like \"other half\". This section of their body is very thick, round, and somewhat lumpy with legs underneath. Siel have eight legs in total.\n\nAt the final pair of legs, a siel's body has a very humanoid rump. They have a foot long caterpillar-like tail. This tail sticks upwards and can swivel in any direction. It is used for squirting their distinctive silk.\n\nSiel have six fingered hands that are incredibly sensitive to touch. When these fingers are pressed to a surface - such as the ground or a person's chest - they are able to pick up the slightest of vibrations.\n\nSince body modding has long been a part of siel culture, many siel change the hair they are born with and their other attributes.\n\n");
	outputCodex(blockHeader("Sexes and Genders"));
	outputCodex("Long ago, siel only had a single pair of genitals located between their rearmost legs. However, due to centuries of modding to mate with other galactic citizens and interbreeding, at least half of them are naturally born with front genitalia as well. Those without them tend to get this 'rectified' with modding.\n\nAs a consequence, almost all siel have two sets of genitals - one set at the front, and one at the back. Since the set of genitals a siel may naturally or artificially get are not limited, there are many naturally born traps and herms (both male and female), cunt boys, and dick girls. Even so, most siel strongly identify as either male or female instead of a third sex.\n\nSiel female genitals are the same regardless of location. Their outer labial lips form a Y shaped fold with the bottom of the 'Y' always facing downwards. The siel have one clit located under the upper fold.\n\nInside these three labial 'flaps' is a vaginal orifice that is internally lumpy and segmented, much like a caterpillar's back turned inward. This resembles and serves as internal cushioning, with each section having its own clenched muscle.\n\nMale siel genitals strongly resemble a caterpillar's lumpy, segmented outside and ends in a small pink, fleshy tip. This tip is smaller than a human glans. This phallus ranges wildly in size from three to nine inches. They have two meatus (colloquially known as \"cock holes\") that ejaculate twin streams of seminal silk.\n\nA siel’s male genitals and testicles are kept within their body, with the former emerging only when they are aroused. The rest of the time this genital region is flat and only features a blue genital slit from which the phallus emerges. Because of this, it is particularly hard to identify siel 'traps' unless they are wearing nothing at all.\n\nMany siel are born with or get a small 'thigh gap' mod beyond their front thighs to make wearing humanoid garments easier. All siel have an anus located below their tail and above their back genitals.\n\n");
	outputCodex(blockHeader("Siel Silk"));
	outputCodex("Located in a siel's rump is a large silk producing sac. This makes up a large portion of their body, allowing all siel to produce incredible amounts of \"siel silk\". Siel silk is distinctly different from terran silk and possesses incredible tensile strength and toughness.\n\nSiel can produce silk from their tail sac in various forms, varying in stickiness, thickness, and malleability. Using these, the siel can produce tiny or large strings and weave them into whatever they desire. They shoot this silk out of the tip of their tails.\n\nWhile there are many artificially manufactured substances superior to it, siel silk is far easier to make and is very vogue. A shirt made of siel silk is not only fashionable, but also light, flexible, and shock absorbent. In all lines of work, siel outfits offer eye-catching protection at an affordable price.\n\nSiel produce finer, higher quality silk when their back genitals or anus is sexually pleasured, as this helps prime the production of their nearby silk sacs. Pleasuring their front genitals does nothing for silk production.\n\nNo matter how sticky or tough it is, silk cannot get entangled or stuck to their own webs. A siel's body is covered in microscopic hairs that can microscopically 'cut' this silk. Their uniquely sensitive hands have the most of these, allowing the species to use them as natural scissors for their own silk.\n\nWhen weaving silk, siel will often attach silk strings to their claw-like prolegs, using them as makeshift holding hooks.\n\n");
	outputCodex(blockHeader("Siel Mating and Reproduction"));
	outputCodex("A siel's silk sac is closely tied to their reproduction and culture for several reasons. The first is that a siel's genitals and anuses are directly tied to their silk sacs.\n\nBoth a siel's anus and pussy, regardless of location, is lined with their special silk. This is also true for the outside of a siel phallus shortly after emergence, providing natural lubrication.\n\nWhether a male or female siel is engaging in intercourse, the result is the same. Usually halfway through intercourse, an aroused siel secretes a 'sticking silk' from the exterior of their phallus, or the inside of their vaginal or anal walls. This is similar to an ausar's knotting, though it is entirely liquid based. This practice is colloquially known as 'silk knotting'.\n\nOnce silk knotted, non-siel mate finds themselves stuck and unable to withdraw, trapped by the siel's sticky, silky genitals. This sticky substance tugs at the partner's inner walls or sensitive phallus from all directions, intensifying the more they thrust or try to withdraw.\n\nA siel phallus shoots copious amounts of silk-like semen, usually enough to ensure an orifice is totally packed full. Usually after mating with a pussy (and sometimes an anus), a siel will shoot a burst of their normal, sticky silk onto the partner's entrance. This ensures the semen is trapped inside and acts as both a method of ensuring impregnation and/or 'claiming' their partner.\n\nIndividuals who have been mated with and sealed in this fashion are easily identifiable by their bloated abdomens, resembling light or heavy pregnancy depending on a siel's potency. After the silk dissolves, a large portion of the semen often rushes out and the individual 'deflates'.\n\nA siel pussy, however, keeps a mate silk knotted until they have utterly flooded the insectile womb with semen, making certain eggs receive proper fertilization. All siel with a front or back pussy have a womb, though it is always located in their caterpillar-like abdomen, as semen travels either back or forward.\n\nAny siel with a womb has a monthly ovulation phase where they produce, hold, and then expel unfertilized eggs through their rearmost or frontmost vagina. If their eggs are fertilized by being washed with semen, they hold these and produce no more eggs until birth six months later.\n\nDuring pregnancy a siel's insectoid stomach, humanoid breasts and stomach swell. While the insectoid stomach swells because of the growing child, the humanoid stomach swells as this is where residual eggs are pushed during the pregnancy period. A Siel female generally gives birth to a clutch of four to eight young at a time.\n\nMost siel reach the cusp of adulthood in sixteen years, slightly shorter than the human norm. As a species, siel have a natural lifespan of up to two centuries and show very few external signs of aging.\n\nEven though siel are fairly fertile, most take contraceptives that prevent unwanted pregnancies. While unprotected sex frequently results in pregnancy, protected sex rarely does.\n\n");
	outputCodex(blockHeader("History and Culture"));
	outputCodex("Siel have been part of mainstream galactic society for centuries. They hail from the arid world of Xhixia, a planet with sharp, sky touching mountain peaks and deep valleys. Located in the Liliaran Nebulae, it is their birth world and the capital planet of their interstellar empire.\n\nSince the only flat parts of Xhixia are either artificial besides the oceans, the siel evolved to heavily rely on their natural silk weaving skills to survive. Siel cities are literally woven out of tightly knit silk and packed together until they become 'solid'.\n\nFrom their meticulously woven silk cities, siel culture thrived and spread across Xhixia. Later discovered by an Ausar exploratory team, the siel quickly found their niche in galactic society. Not only did they excel at providing their special silk, the Siel were gifted in any area that required fine detail and deft hands.\n\nIn the musical world, siel are incredibly gifted players of plucked string instruments. Due to their extremely sensitive six fingered hands and lifetime of working with string vibration, they are truly unparalleled in this area.\n\nOne of the most well known traits of siel is their culture of tight fitting outfits and bondage activities. Before body modding was introduced to siel society, male siel were strongly predisposed towards erectile disfunction. This led to a culture of bondage where either a female siel would tie up a male's genitals (or they would tie up their own) to increase blood circulation.\n\nOver time, bondage has become not only part of siel mainstream culture, but an integral part of their culture. Females and males alike displayed their silk-tying process on their own bodies like a peacock plumage, attempting to attract potential mates.\n\nEven after the original problem of erectile dysfunction was solved, siel still consider it 'lewd' not to tie up a mate during intercourse. Siel attitudes towards non-bondage are similar to human attitudes towards anal intercourse in the early twenty-first century.\n\nSiel as a species have wholeheartedly embraced body modding. At first, the siel used it to solve their species's disposition towards erectile disfunction. Since then they have used it to give their species an extra set of genitals between their front legs. When they are not born with them naturally, genital modding is subsidized by most siel planetary governments.\n\nIt is common for a siel to mod their natural hair, eye, and skin color. There are still small sects of conservative siel who traditionally oppose both body modding and having sex without bondage, considering it 'impure' and 'immoral' behavior.\n\n");
	outputCodex(blockHeader("Religion"));
	outputCodex("Siel have a native monotheistic religion called Zyism, centered around a creator-deity called \"Zyi\". The siel believe Zyi created the universe and their life spans, tying them all together in a gigantic invisible web called \"the life thread\".\n\nZyi spends their time tugging on the strings of each and every life, though their reasons are unknown. The siel believe Zyi simply does this because they are Zyi, and no other reason. The siel believe Zyi is both female and male and has many arms and legs - as many as there are people in the universe.\n\nThe siel do not worship Zyi as much as recognize them. They believe manipulating Zyi is pointless, and prayer is an attempt at manipulation.\n\nExtremist Zyi worshippers often believe that sex without bondage and body modding is impure and against nature, a byproduct of siel culture being corrupted by mainstream galactic society.\n\nMost Zyi worshippers do not share this belief, however, many non-Zyi worshippers lump them together with these much louder fanatics.\n");

The insides of their mouths are a reddish purple, with a thin, pale ridge of cartilage in place of teeth, making chewing tough food nearly impossible.\n\nThe most notable feature of the kerokoras face is their tongue. On average, their tongues can extend between eight and twelve feet, roughly twice their height. These prehensile tongues are made of twitch muscle, and capable of extending at nearly the same speed as a traditionally gunpowder-accelerated kinetic projectile, allowing them to hunt with the slightly sticky appendage.

They then find a male and repeatedly whip them with their tongue until the subject is in a rutting frenzy and doesn't care that he is mating with an alien species.\n\nIt should be noted that while any given kerokoras is resistant to their own venom, they are not immune to the sweat of other kerokoras. This sweat covers their entire body, and also acts to keep their skin clean.\n\nUpon being fertilized, the kerokoras will begin to develop an eggsack with anywhere from two to six eggs. After a relatively short initial gestation period of two weeks, the eggs are laid, generally in shallow, swampy water. These eggs typically hatch about a month later.\n\nKerokoras young are born without limbs, and with a long tail, and spend the first year of their development in water, before their limbs develop and they join the tribe in the trees.

Known as Rosha, it is a lush, verdant orb that sits just slightly closer to its sun than Earth, resulting in an overall tropical and sub-tropical climate. Much of Rosha is grassland or open scrub forests, with dense jungles towards the cooler polar regions, vast mangrove swamps along the coastlines and a dense strip of arid savannas and bushland across the equators. Only at the very poles themselves do tundras and taigas form.\n\nAs a consequence, kaithrit are most comfortable in similar environments; the jungle-rich world of Mhen'gha is expected to see many of these aliens coming to settle, with its wild, lawless frontier world status sure to act as a magnet for this bold, brash species. However, Kaithrit have been seen all over the galaxy. Some of the more daring have succumbed to their wanderlust and taken to traveling through space, often in clan crews, to colonize and seek their fortune abroad.\n\nThough it is true that many kaithrit enjoy travelling through space, the truth is that the great majority of them are traditionalists unwilling to leave their home planet, Even if they do take trips to stations and other planets. After the Great Exodus, an event that marked the beginning of a new age, not many Kaithrit born on their homeworld choose to leave it.\n\n");

Furthering the gender confusion are males who remain in close, constant proximity to an expectant female. Pregnant kaithrit emit a steady wave of hormonal musk which can trigger a lactation response in males, swelling his breasts and allowing mother and father alike to nurse. Kaithrit pregnancy lasts approximately eight months after conception, and results in one to three kittens, though incidents of multiple births are quite low -- most pregnancies result in a single healthy child. Male hormonal balance tends to return to equilibrium faster than females, allowing them to recover from the effects of a female's pregnancy and return to their normal chest size quickly.\n\nConfirmed kaithrit crossbreeding has been documented between both humans and ausar. Human/kaithrit hybrids tend to have more human-like facial features and typically only have one tail. Ausar/kaithrit crossbreeds are most distinctive from purebred kaithrit because males and hermaphrodites typically have ausar-like phalluses, albeit usually with the typical kaithrit texturing.\n\n");
	outputCodex(blockHeader("History"));
	outputCodex("The kaithrit are believed to have a rather human-like evolutionary story, beginning as tree-dwellers who, as the trees gave way to grassland, evolved towards a bipedal frame. As one may expect, the kaithrit's most distant ancestor was more feline than primate. Perhaps because of this, gender roles also evolved differently to humans; unlike human precursors, these proto-kaithrit were a matriarchal species. The females were, as they are today, bigger and stronger than the males, responsible for hunting and warring with other prides, while the males cared for the offspring. This inversion of human gender roles shows through in many aspects of kaithrit society; it is far more common for a female kaithrit to initiate a relationship than it is for the males, for instance.");
	outputCodex("\n\nHigher intelligence developed in-line with other observed evolution; with bipedal locomotion freeing the hands for other uses, sapience soon followed, the kaithrit becoming masters of tools and molders of their environment. While many aspects of their feral past were discarded on the road to civilization, others remained, and one of these is the social dominance of female over male. Male kaithrit are seen as creators, shapers, builders and caretakers, while females are seen as warriors, pioneers, adventurers and explorers. Men are kept to the background by society, due to the belief in their passivity and frailness; while things are not quite so bad that men are 'househusbands' with no greater role in life than to get married, father daughters and look after the house while the woman earns money to support, they are encouraged to take up more intellectual or otherwise passive roles.");
	outputCodex("\n\nIndeed, kaithrit society is in many ways stunningly sexist. Male kaithrit are forbidden to uphold matters of state or assume political roles, because it is believed they are too weak and inept to make hard, necessary decisions - indeed, this same belief holds them away from any position of power or control over others, especially over women. Society coddles them in many ways; males who commit crimes receive weaker punishment than females do, goods crafted by males attract more money, and they receive better service in restaurants and stores. Indeed, it's surprising just how much they are favored - some xenobiologists and historians point to a significant difference in population ratios between males and females as the reason for these differences, with males being relatively less common than females. In some colony worlds, the lower occurrence of male births can be cause for a great deal of concern, and result in even more stringent constraints on male activity.\n\nThis is not to say that there is not a division between viewpoints on these aspects. While a distinct number of males are accepting of the impositions against their gender due to the privileges they receive, still others resent it and wish to bring their culture more in line with that of many others of the U.G.C., with true equality between the genders. This viewpoint became more popular amongst males, and even began gaining ground amongst the females after contact with other species was established, but it was the Great Exodus that caused the viewpoint to become the simmering underground faction that it is today.\n\nThe Great Exodus was the period immediately following the kaithrit’s contact with the U.G.C. The idea of other planets, people, and other societies fascinated the kaithrit, and as a result the more daring females jumped at the chance to get a license and fly a starship to the great beyond. This was a time of great frustration for males; they were denied the rights to take the test for a license as they were deemed too frail to handle a spaceship. While this didn’t stop some males from stowing aboard visiting ships or even stealing ships for themselves, their restriction from starflight became a matter of great debate, and finally brought to light the fight for equality.\n\nOf course, it must be noted that this patronizing attitude towards males predominantly applies to the kaithrit of Rosha; offworlders, especially those who have many generations removed from the homeworld, are far less traditional.\n\n");
	outputCodex(blockHeader("Other Notes"));
	outputCodex("Hermaphrodites are an uncertainty in the kaithrit viewpoint of the world, and reactions can vary wildly from settlement to settlement. Perhaps as a response, hermaphroditic kaithrit have always been inclined towards nomadic behaviors.\n\nAs noted above, kaithrits have feline-like tails, with two to a specimen. These tails are functionally prehensile, if too weak in most cases to use for wielding weapons. An entire social strata exists within kaithrit society involving them; tail body-language is an important part of understanding kaithrits and how they communicate with each other. Motions and positioning, these can all speak volumes to another kaithrit or a trained observer. Contact with a tail is a social language in its own right.  Who a kaithrit touches, how, when, and where, are all bound by distinctive aspects of kaithrit proprietary. For example, a simple looping of one tail tip around another kaithrit's tail-tip signifies a friendly acquaintance and is a polite greeting, whilst doing the same with both tails on the same side is a gesture of sibling affection and doing it with one tail on either side, so that both Kaithrits must be facing each other, is a romantic gesture similar to a cuddle. More intimate tail-touches are supposed to be kept private or to the bedroom, but may be seen as an expression of dominance in a social context.\n\nWhen dealing with aliens, a kaithrit's tail-touching often serves as an indicator of social interest; they prefer to stroke the alien's tail, if they have one, but the buttocks and thighs will suffice. A side effect of this, though, is that most tail-touching gestures they can perform are signifiers of lust or camaraderie - the equivalent of a friendly spank on the ass, for example.\n");

The galotians did not understand most species’ need to be exposed to gaseous oxygen in order to remain alive. Rather than devour the resulting corpses, the living oozes spat out the lifeless bodies and lumbered away. For no explicable reason, ‘Attacks’ died away almost entirely after the first week of contact with the rest of the galaxy. Plans to declare the planet unfit for colonization were scuttled, and more and more visitors came to the wet, swampy planet, seeking riches amongst the muck.\n\nGalotia was mineral poor, unfit for most kinds of farming, and only rich in diverse, if seemingly useless life. Interest in the planet died down until only a few long-term biological survey teams remained. They observed the native galotians enveloping other creatures, sometimes for hours at a time, then releasing them, seemingly unharmed.\n\nWhile studying this phenomenon, the scientists made little progress. It wasn’t until near the end of the survey that a massive and unexpected breakthrough finally happened.\n\nA galotian, one of the native blob monsters, appeared at the edge of camp in the shape of one of the younger, shapelier researchers.

The galotian even molded her body to mimic the appearance of the scientist’s nightclothes.\n\nThen, it spoke in broken ausuri, apologizing for killing an explorer nearly a year ago.\n\nThe expedition was thrown into chaos. No one had thought these seemingly simple creatures could be sapient, and the very idea of one learning a core language unaided rattled every assumption about this planet and its ecosystem.\n\nThat galotian called herself Galos, and her influence paved the way for normalizing interactions between Galotia and the rest of the galaxy. Once galotian feeding habits were understood and the gooey aliens learned how not to kill their “prey”, they became sought-after companions the galaxy over.\n\nThe troubled history of Galotia is held up across the galaxy as the original success story of long-term planetary surveys and as reason enough to continue funding studies on every survivable rush planet.\n\n");

These cells are more than ready to alter their purpose on demand, swapping between multiple sets of DNA in order to rebuild themselves for a new purpose. Some older, more experienced galotians are even capable of incredible feats of self-induced bio-engineering, producing chemical and biological cocktails to permanently increase a sexual partner’s usefulness as a food source.\n\nGalotians are as adept at feeding on their own cells as easily as they are at feeding on anything else, causing them to grow or shrink in accordance with their nutritional needs. This is effectively a double-edged sword for these liquid ladies. Since every cell effectively functions as a neuron, a lack of feeding can lead to a loss in intellect. Starving galotians can become as small as a basketball before temporarily losing sapience. Death typically occurs soon after.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, extremely well fed galotians can grow as large as elephants.

The male places this penis inside his partner's cloaca and thrusts until climax, whereupon he ejaculates semen produced by glands within his abdominal cavity. In the case of a male copulating with a female, she may shift into a front-mount or missionary position before ejaculation, in order to allow him to slide his penis all the way past the entrance and up to her uterus, to grant a greater chance of fertilizing a large number of her eggs. To be offered such an opportunity is a sign of great affection. Particularly effeminate males sometimes emulate this behavior during intercourse with other males, though only when being taken anally or with extensive body modification as otherwise the male cloaca is not deep enough.\n\nIn situations where the female does not favor the male, wants multiple sires for her clutch, or does not want to lay at all, she attempts to hold him away and allow him to ejaculate no further than the deepest part of the cloaca; she may force him to pull out entirely.

Fashion over wearing tail-fur trimmed or untrimmed varies from place to place. Long, luxurious hair grows out from the calves below the knee, with this excessive hair ending just above the ankle.

However, approximately 1 in 3 laquines is a \"lop-eared laquine\", whose ears are soft and flexible enough that they can't support themselves upright without conscious effort on the part of the laquine and normally \"flop\" down the back or sides of the head.

This fur isn't especially dense normally, as laquines evolved in warm environments, but does respond to cold conditions by growing denser and thicker in an effort to help preserve warmth. \"Woolly laquines\", who naturally grow thicker and lusher fur, are known to exist; this seems to be a result of genetic drifting from interbreeding with lucanis.  Laquine fur tends towards dark colorations - blacks, browns, reds, navy blue, etc - but is often offset by light or even bright colors (creams, oranges, tans, etc), and contrasting patterns are seen as attractive in many laquine sub-cultures. Hair is usually a noticeably contrasting color to fur.\n\n");
	outputCodex("<b>Sexual Organs & Erogenous Zones:</b> Laquines have a fairly standard array of sexual features for humanoids: two nipples, a vaginal orifice, an external phallus, and a pair of external testicles, with combinations as expected for the gender. The nipples, positioned in the \"normal\" place for humanoids, grow into permanent breasts at puberty.  The penis is the most unusual physical trait of laquines, and instantly separates them from \"mere\" anthropomorphic rabbits.  A laquine's phallus is \"free-falling\", like a human's, and consists of a hairless sheathe of foreskin into which the phallus proper retracts when not aroused. In shape, the exposed phallus physically most closely resembles the phallus of an Earthly horse, complete with the ability to \"flare\", or have its edges swell upon climax.\n\nSimilarly, laquines have a \"marecunt\" to match their \"horsedick\"; their vagina is very elastic and naturally produces copious amounts of pheromone-laden lubricants.  This is believed to be an evolutionary adaptation to cope with the size of the average laquine penis.  Average size of penises is a length of 10 to 14 inches and a girth of 2 to 3 inches.  Average testes size is golfball to apple sized, and extraordinarily productive beyond that; laquine ejaculate typically measures in terms of litres. Breast size is affected by how many offspring have been produced; upon reaching breeding age, most laquines range from large A-cups to small C-cups upon puberty, though proportions as massive as FF-cups have been reported from dedicated broodmothers.\n\n");

Medicinal supplements to quell these urges, and to reduce the arousing musk that they produce during this period, are now freely available, but it has had its impact on their social structure.\n\nHermaphrodites do feel heat, like females, but usually in a much weaker fashion. Approximately one fertile week out of every four, however, triggers an even stronger reaction than it does in females, overwhelming the laquine's mind with the need to father and conceive offspring. In this state, they have even been known to sexually assault others in desperate search of sexual release. Hermaphrodites who feel their \"burning\" coming on traditionally take alleviating medicine and seek seclusion, emerging only when it is over... assuming they don't have one or more partners that they choose to sate their lust with, of course.\n\nConception occurs in the 'typical' mammalian format, and a litter of two to eight offspring gestate internally for a period of six months before being born alive. As this time period means that offspring from the last breeding season are born during the start of the next, and laquine biologies recover quickly, it is possible for a willing female laquine to be pregnant constantly throughout the year. An infant laquine is a small creature, about the size of a Terran rabbit, and quite helpless, dependent upon its parental figures to care for it for about a decade before reaching adulthood.\n\n");

Semen quantity boosters are the primary subject of sexual spam amongst laquines, and semen-related mods are fairly common in their culture.

	outputCodex("The mental effects propagate over a period of 48 hours, plus or minus 12. They start with a rapid loss of willpower and end with a huge dip in perceived intelligence. Both are relative to the user's original aptitude; particularly strong-willed women seemed best able to handle their new drives and shorter attention spans. Actual I.Q.s are unchanged, though new cows have great difficulty maintaining motivation for nonsexual pursuits, leading to a bimbo stereotype. Promises of longer milkings for higher scores increased standardized test results to near pre-treatment levels. Adding a fuck from a treated male, or bull, as a prize eliminated the discrepancy.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThose changes are gradual enough that most girls barely notice them. One secondary effect that every girl notices and is happy to talk about is the all-encompassing EUPHORIA that being treated brings. It too starts slow and ramps up over the 48 hour period, but it's impossible not to notice how natural smiling becomes or how easy it is to lose oneself in the simpler pleasures afterward. Everyday activities like bathing become exquisitely enjoyable, almost spiritual activities for treated cow-girls.");
	outputCodex("\n\nAnother important secondary characteristic of the Treatment is an increase in libido. Treated women find themselves almost comically easily aroused, and with heightened libidos and a happy disposition, they'll find themselves fucking and breeding many times more often than untreated individuals. While many women display concern about this before taking the Treatment, there has not been a single cow reporting displeasure with this facet of her life after a month of time to adjust. New Texas has not had a reported case of depression in three centuries.");

Rebuilding a body burns quite a lot of calories, and facilitating the aforementioned mental restructuring is also quite energy intensive. Treated individuals actually increase their neural density by roughly 5%, owing largely to the ability to process new sensory data from all the new nerves. Only extremely obese individuals find their appetites unaffected.");
	outputCodex("\n\nBreast growth is the second effect to manifest, and it lasts for days. Both nipple and mammary tissue expand greatly over the week-long period, accompanied by a kind of pleasant tingle that makes them almost impossible not to heft and handle every few minutes. The growth is typically steady, though large changes overnight manifest in some budding cows. A woman's original bust size has almost zero correlation with her treated size. Some of the smallest girls wind up huge, while more than one chesty maiden barely get an inch or two added to their racks.");
	outputCodex("\n\nObese women invariably lose weight. Hip bones widen. Cellulite smooths while wrinkles vanish. Lips often plump and soften, becoming chap-resistant. Hard facial features sometimes soften and ease slightly towards classical beauty. These effects are almost universal.

	outputCodex("\n\nMost noticeably, small, rounded horns will typically grow in on the upper forehead. \"Getting your horns\" is a sign of adulthood on New Texas, but other bovine features may occur as well. Ears, cow tails, and furred thighs are all common. Some women may find their feet sculpted into hooves or hoof-like heels as well. Multiple nipples or breasts are somewhat rare, but do occur frequently enough for it to be a well-understood phenomenon. Cows with both are typically considered very desirable, both as milk producers and as mates.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThe least visible changes all occur inside the breasts and genital region. The former get noticeably bigger and gain longer, puffier nipples, but they also triple in nerve density over the course of the treatment. As one would expect, this has resulted in an increase in the popularity of breast-play. Adjustments to the milk glands improve the flow, consistency, and taste of lactation, resulting in milkings that are described as \"almost as good as sex.\" Milking barns and breast-massages have become popular destinations for cows who desire to retain their autonomy. Self-cleaning, fluid-repellant seats are government mandated in such businesses for health and safety reasons.");
	outputCodex("\n\nMore importantly, the genitals get a complete if subtle makeover. Pubic hair falls out roughly 50% of the time. 11% of the time, the opposite happens, and the fibers will thicken quite significantly. Pubic mounds swell, making cameltoes almost ubiquitous. Labia minora rarely expand, but when they do, it's typically on girls with quite small lips pre-Treatment. The real changes occur in the clitoris and inside the vaginal passage.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThe Treatment universally causes clitoral expansion while maintaining the organ's original nerve density, resulting in a bud that easily swells up to the size of a gumball when aroused. Lubrication secretion is nearly tripled, and as a side-effect the clitoris becomes self-lubricating as well. It's hard to miss the gleaming pink pleasure target on a randy cow and impossible not to grind against when fucking from any angle. Nerve density inside is vastly increased (by a factor of approximately 2.3), particularly around the cervix. Clusters of new pleasure nerves form there, resulting in a new, deep G-spot.");
	outputCodex("\n\nAll the new nerves allow a much finer degree of control over the surrounding muscles, and accompanying mental changes wire them to squeeze and caress on autopilot. Some manual control is possible with concentration, but when pressed, treated women didn't seem to see the point in it. Their partners universally enjoy the enhanced textures and movement her muscles offer. Texan cow-girl pussies are considered some of the universe's finest at extracting human genetic material, rivalling even KihaCorp's latest synthpussies for the sheer pleasure offered to their partners.");
	outputCodex("\n\nOf course, generally elasticity is increased as well to accommodate the enhanced, swollen girths that the treatment provides for males, and pheromone production goes through the roof, matched to an increase in sensitivity to male odors. Treated girls can literally smell a cock, and if they approve of it, the lucky boy is probably going to find himself more than a little hard thanks to her subconscious production of aromatic sex-signals.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<b>There is a twelve page list of additional physical mutations and effects, but the most common are listed below:</b>\n* Suppression of gag reflex. Nearly every girl has a reduced gag reflex, though some retain some small measure of it.\n* Horse-like ears. This typically occurs in cows with higher muscle mass. Cows with this mutation are sometimes referred to as mares.\n* Fully prehensile tails.\n* Oral erogenous zone. Most commonly centered on the lips but sometimes the tongue is included as well. Nerve density approaches genital levels. Most girls with this mutation find oral nearly as pleasant as vaginal. Popsicle sales are well above terran standards on New Texas.\n* Cum highs. This trait causes the concentrated release of endorphins in response to any exposure to cum. It appears to function by triggering an allergy-like response.\n* Fuckable Nipples. Very few cows develop fuckable nipples, but those that do invariably had larger breasts and nipples naturally. They develop a large, nerve-lined milk-duct behind the nipple which can be penetrated with after a slight degree of training. Sexual intercourse with such a passage triggers immediate milk production far beyond normal. Scientists are currently unsure if this functions as a stand-in for lubricants or if it serves some other purpose. It is widely viewed as one of the messiest forms of coitus on New Texas.\n* Pseudophalli. Hermaphroditism is almost unheard of New Texas. After the treatment, both sexes seem quite content to fit into binary gender roles. But every so often, something goes wrong, and a girl will find her clit swelling during her transformation. While a little growth is normal, cows developing pseudophalli surpass fully treated girls in clitoris size by the third day of their metamorphosis. Nerve growth cannot keep pace with such a large expansion, resulting in sensation levels that barely surpass New Texan penises. Cows with pseudophalli display much higher incidences of lesbianism and bisexuality than normal.\n* Udders. It may be common on New Texas to colloquially refer to breasts as udders, but some women will find their bellies getting pinker, bulgier, and growing a plethora of nipples. Women with udders moo approximately three times as often other cows.\n* Long tongues: Despite the name, long tongues come in a large variety of shapes and sizes: elongated human tongues, smooth and broad bovine ones, even forked snake-like ones, to name a few. Bovine tongues seem most prevalent.\n* Extra fluff: The fluff at the end of some cows' tails grows far beyond normal, sometimes growing to a beachball-sized tuft of softness.\n* Ear sensitivity: Increases in tactile sensation along the outside of the ears are fairly common, but in some cases it can match the breasts and nipples for sheer sensitivity. Many girls with this mutation get slightly bigger, floppier ears to go with it. Petting these cows is the quickest way to soothe them into a relaxed, happy state should they ever be upset.\n\n");
	outputCodex(blockHeader("Male Mental Effects"));
	outputCodex("Like their feminine counterparts, males experience a series of mental effects that manifest over a roughly 48 hour period. Unlike the females, they suffer no loss of perceived IQ, but they do experience several other key changes.\n\nFirst and foremost is an uptick in confidence. Whether deserved or not, treated males - or bulls as they are sometimes called - are generally confident in their own abilities and their place in society. Testosterone-laden men who are sure of their own beliefs are sure to come to conflict, but another effect helps to prevent that. Namely, the growth of a cooperative instinct that is most powerful after orgasm, working with the cow-girls' natural nymphomaniac instincts to keep everyone happy and willing to compromise for the good of all.\n\nAnother change that is almost unnoticeable at first is an increase in satisfaction from physical tasks. Exercise rapidly becomes far more pleasant. New Texans can get the equivalent of a runner's high from almost any physical task, and linkages between muscle fatigue and arousal cause many to frequently work out, if only to enjoy hours of blowjobs in the post-workout haze.\n\nEven without exercising fueling it, male sex drives accelerate up to the point where rampant sex is a foregone conclusion. Most boys look forward to their second puberty, their only concern that they might lose their hard-earned ranking in an extranet game due to their new drives.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<b>Additional mental effects may include:</b>\n* Sudden new fetish gain, particularly pregnancy and lactation.\n* Cravings for vaginal fluids.\n* Decreased submissiveness and an uptick in sexual dominance.\n* Rarely, complete submissiveness. Bulls unfortunate enough to gain this trait are typically referred to as faux-cows.\n\n");
	outputCodex(blockHeader("Male Physical Effects"));
	outputCodex("Male physical effects take just as long to manifest as the females', but they're concentrated almost entirely in the genitals and related hormone production. The first and most important effect is an increase in testicle size. Every male experiences significant and prolonged swelling of the testes across the weeklong period. Egg to apple-sized balls are the result, and with increased size comes increased testosterone production. Treated males pack on plenty of muscle during the weeklong change, and they keep it on with ease thanks to the flood of hormones their swollen cum-factories produce.");
	outputCodex("\n\nOther hormones flood the budding bulls' system along with the testosterone, causing a final growth spurt that brings most bulls up to somewhere between six and eight feet of height. The weeklong growth spurt is only mildly uncomfortable for the growing males, but fully acclimating to a heightened stature often takes months if not years.\n\nThe thing that most excites untreated men are the effects it has on the penis. Every male gains at least two or three inches of length backed up by proportional increases girth, with many seeing an increase of up to eight inches. Data on nonhuman individuals is sparse, but reports indicate that tauric individuals or members from well-endowed races can grow twice as much as the terran average. Nerve growth slightly exceeds the rate of expansion, resulting in a more sensitive tallywhacker. This might be a problem if refractory periods weren't virtually eliminated. Instead, it merely allows the men to more frequently release themselves inside their jiggling mates.\n\nThe reduction in refractory period is accomplished via a retooling of all the male sex glands. Larger testes help, but they would mean little without a more efficient, larger prostate, redesigned seminal vesicles, and rearranged synapses to control it all. Bulls are capable of ejaculating ten times an hour so long as they have access to sufficient nutrient and fluid sources with particularly virile specimens able to produce gallons of the stuff when thoroughly \"milked.\" Staying hard after an orgasm is as easy as deciding to stay inside and keep thrusting.\n\nHorns start coming in by day two, but it isn't until day four that they're large enough for accurate predictions of the final size a bull is likely to get. Charts are available upon request at most medical facilities on planet. Much larger than the little nubs the girls get, the men's horns tend to be larger, wider spaced, and more horizontal, resembling a bull's. Horn size is widely assumed to relate to genital size, though there is absolutely no basis to this in actual fact. Groups of males still rag on friends with the smallest horns all the same.\n\nAs the newly-matured bulls finish their transformation, hormonal shifts trigger subtly altered pheromones to be released, allowing for basic emotional information to be communicated on a nonverbal, subconscious level. Treated females are receptive and have pheromones of their own, allowing members of the opposite sexes to rapidly assess the other's level of attraction with a minimum of social posturing. Untreated females may note a slight musk in the air, and may still respond to more basic pheromonal signals on a lesser level. It is not uncommon for bulls to attempt to seduce female tourists using as few words as possible, a social competition that is frowned upon in polite society but persists all the same.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<b>Many other mutations can occur on top of the basic effects. The most common are listed below:</b>\n* Animal phalli. Gaining a bestial member is a very common side-effect that dates back to the usage of animal-sourced DNA to create some of the early treatment effects. Rather than eliminate this effect, modern version of the treatment appear to have had it enhanced to allow for even greater variety and improved aesthetics. Horse, dog, and great cat members are familiar sights on the bulls of New Texas.\n* Furred legs and or arms: Coarse fur will sometimes grow over the limbs and very rarely on the chest.\n* Increased amounts of facial hair: Facial hair always grows faster post-treatment, but some bulls find it to be denser, courser, and cover areas that it did not grow in before.\n* A cow tail: Many consider this to be a sign of strength.\n* Bovine ears\n* Doubled testes: The sudden division of one pair of nuts into two makes for a weightier sack and an uncomfortable time sitting in certain ways, but it allows for messier, more virile ejaculations.\n* Exceptional pheromones: Some individuals’ pheromone glands go into overdrive, resulting in a disruptive cloud of musk that can easily overwhelm the unprepared.\n\n");

Labor is initiated when the soft outer shell dissolves. This produces non-parasitic offspring that are always born in pairs, and always the same gender as the host parent. Hair, eye, and skin color is also determined by the host parent.

The honeypot ‘gene’ is in fact a complicated evolutionary marvel that allows the gold myr to store excess nutrients inside their abdomens or breasts for times of scarcity - or to later share with their hungrier countrymen. The organ used for storage falls largely along gender lines. Males use their abdomen and females their breasts. Some rare females use both, and are even able to shunt mass between the two.\n\nWith sufficient nutrition they can become so swollen with their nectar they practically glow amber.

As the name suggests, queens are highly revered by other golds, some even revered as goddesses.\n\nUntil her first pregnancy, a queen is indistinguishable from any other infertile female, but once she gestates her first clutch of eggs, she will undergo a second puberty, metamorphosing to have a second set of nutrient-lactating breasts, a larger body, and a hugely swollen abdomen. Her abdomen will slowly grow over time, gradually increasing her ability to reproduce. Queens tower over other myr, but their reproductive swelling prevents them from being able to properly defend themselves in a conflict.\n\nMales are shorter lived and winged, possessing considerably less strength than the average female due to his lighter frame. Affectionately called \"drones\" by their female counterparts, most males live in relative luxury. Those not serving a queen are so prized that they can live a life of ease.

One function of the thollums is to allow them free training in any actively practiced discipline.\n\nThe Gilden Republic (closest approximate translation), is ruled by the Council of Queens, a governmental body made up of every myr capable of reproduction. Each queen’s power is relative to the number of her offspring, with older, more fertile queens carrying significantly more weight than their younger, inexperienced peers. This bizarre, motherhood based political system seems to work well for the gold myr.\n\nU.G.C. researchers have seen few if any signs of dissent amongst the tawny ant-people.

Most served as nurses, administrators, and factory workers, freeing more females up to fight.\n\nThese newfound demands of labor have, reportedly, began an accelerated male rights movement, similar in nature to the women's rights movement of 20th century Earth.

Some U.G.C. sources have speculated that the Federation may have been in conflict with other, as yet unknown civilizations in the northern and western reaches of the planet for generations.\n\nMilitary tactics and technology among the red myr are significantly more advanced than those of the golds, and for the most part are reliant upon massed infantry charges supported by heavy artillery when fighting above ground, or on chemical weapons and phalanx-style shield walls when underground. Red myr weapons technology primarily employs smokeless gunpowder in revolvers, lever- and bolt-action rifles, and primitive air-cooled automatic weapons.\n\nSupplementing their hand-to-hand abilities, red myr females have venomous saliva which, on contact, causes a mild paralysis in the victim. The venom is known to cause a \"red heat\" sensation, inspiring rampant lust in the victim and usually putting him utterly at the mercy of the myr victor.

Though not all red myr follow this doctrine, the end result is a society that is truly and monumentally well ordered: hierarchies are well-established and held up for public scrutiny, unemployment is virtually non-existent, and civil disorder is next to unheard of, even during the darkest hours of the war.\n\nThe Scarlet Federation is primarily a military organization, and the red myr are effectively ruled by a junta of generals collectively called the High Command who took power after several unification conflicts brought the scattered red myr city-states under collective control. Military service is considered a sacred civil duty, and the ability to vote and serve public office is restricted to veterans only. Before the war, the Federation military was volunteer-only, though the press of seven years of war has necessitated a draft, much as it has among the gold myr.\n\nRed myr society is highly nationalistic and collectivist, promoting cooperation and national unity. Social power is held almost exclusively by the military, veterans, and the Federation High Command. Most national industries are government-supported private corporations, while citizens are free to create smaller private businesses.\n\nWhile the society endorsed by the Gilden Republic was on the verge of collapse under the strain the war, Federation society thrived thanks to vast acquisitions of land and resources heralded by their military victories. However, the strain of the war was felt heavily on the red myr population, which began the conflict significantly smaller than that of the gold, and has dwindled dangerously due to losses during the campaign. Had the infantry invasion of Gildenmere been launched, U.G.C. scientists suggest incurred casualties could have rendered the red myr population unviable -- too small to avoid genetic damage due to inbreeding and leaving them highly vulnerable to disease or mutation.\n\nRelationships: Due to the overwhelmingly female-heavy population, males are in high demand: most infertile females are unlikely to ever see a male in person, much less be able to copulate with him. As such, lesbian relationships are extremely common and widely accepted. Indeed, a marriage between male and female is quite literally unheard of in myr society; most males are shared between groups of bisexual females.\n\nRed myr sexual norms are difficult for some outsiders to comprehend, even to natives of Myrellion. Most red myr are open about their sexuality, and have little inhibition from doting on lovers and public displays of affection. However, unlike the gold myr, reds are highly averse to public nudity and blatant sex acts. Social norms dictate that sex is to be done in private seclusion with trusted lovers: there is no shame in the act, but rather it is deemed too personal and emotional to share with strangers.\n\nThe advent of casual sex is only a very recent phenomenon spurred on by the war. While monogamy is uncommon among the myr, relationships were expected to be devoted and deep. This attitude changed during the war, thanks to the concept of \"trench wives\" -- females that soldiers have either captured or brought from home who serve their needs between battles. These relationships are based on lust and physical pleasure, and have (some say alarmingly) disrupted the polyamorous partnerships more common in years past. The trench wife phenomenon is seen as a necessary evil by most red officers, as the Federation simply does not have the resources to deal with the sheer number of prisoners taken during the war. Allowing soldiers to keep their own captives, and insisting that they care for them, is seen as more humanitarian than prison camps and puts the brunt of the administrative needs (food, shelter, etc.) on the shoulders of individual unit commanders.\n\n");

	outputCodex("The galaxy is rife with computer systems, both rudimentary and sapient, we collectively label ‘artificial intelligences’. The term itself is a common misnomer, a holdover from the era of popular science fiction and primitive computing. Today, the programs we would term ‘artificial intelligences’ broadly belong to one of three categories: Virtual Intelligences, Artificial Intelligences (Designed), and Artificial Intelligences (Grown). The distinction between the three is, unfortunately, less commonly known than one might first think, given the prevalence of virtual and artificial intelligences in our corner of the galaxy.");

	outputCodex("\n\nVirtual Intelligences are the handy computer systems we use for everyday activities, from the old tablet type hand computers to the onboard pilot-assist programs loaded into most starships. Some operate entirely within machinery or computer networks, others have ‘personas’ which facilitate more comfortable communication between themselves and organics. They're simple, though- some might even say outright stupid. V.I.s can only perform pre-programmed actions, and have very little to no capability for adaptation or self-directed thought. They're not sapient, have no rights, and are mass produced by companies like Kiha and JoyCo for a huge variety of purposes, from operating heavy machinery to coordinating traffic.");

	outputCodex("\n\nOn a core world, most people will interact with dozens of V.I.s every day- frequently without even realizing it. The traffic control systems on Terra, the greeting bots in the hotel lobby, and even your food replicator are all run by V.I.s of varying complexity. What we today know as virtual intelligences have been slowly developed over the course of millennia, gaining in complexity and computational power. It was not until quite recently, however, that our understanding of synthetic intelligence systems evolved beyond mere computing, and into a new and wonderful strain of life: true artificial intelligence. ");

	outputCodex("\n\nPerhaps the greatest scientific breakthrough after the advent of the Warp Gates was the introduction of true artificial intelligences whose ability to reason, adapt, and learn equaled or exceeded their organic designers. The first of these are what we today call A.I.-D, or designed A.I.s. Designed intelligences are made in much the same way as V.I.s are, via intensive system design and implementation processes, potentially involving thousands of A.I. system programmers. Designed intelligences are usually the product of mega-corporations such as JoyCo, who mass-produce them from selections of templates which, when combined, create a functional intelligence. Each template is monumentally expensive to make, both in terms of hardware and software design costs.");

	outputCodex("\n\nThe downside to A.I.-Ds fundamental design is their emotional state- or the lack thereof, some would say. The ability to program a personality and emotions is still largely beyond modern technique. As a result, most designed intelligences can be best described as cold and calculating, acting without investment or attachment outside of their own necessity. They fulfil their directives with ruthless, cunning efficiency. A.I.-Ds are precision instruments, able to accomplish more in the blink of an eye than a team of organics could in a day, but at the cost of intuition, emotion, and morality.");

	outputCodex("\n\nThere is much debate over whether or not to officially classify A.I.-Ds as ‘people’. While their sapience is indisputable by any conventional method, the coldness of their programming is unsettling both in interaction and from a legal standpoint. A designed intelligence without rigid restraints and safeguards in place upon its programming can be a truly terrifying monster, as the Carissia Cruiseliners incident at the start of the 13th Planet Rush attests. At the very least, all designed intelligences must be created with Asimov's laws firmly in place to avoid danger to themselves and those around them.");

	outputCodex("\n\nThe same need not be said for grown intelligences, the third breed of A.I. commonly found in the galaxy, and the class most closely resembling organics. A.I.-Gs experience the whole range of human emotion: they can be happy, feel fear and doubt, and even love. This range of emotions is achieved in A.I.-Gs where it cannot be in designed intelligences thanks to the basis from which grown intelligences are, as the name suggests, grown: biological minds. A.I.-Gs are based upon brain scans of organic infants, usually human or ausar. They form the initial state of a primitive self-modifying machine, from which a simulated neural network can be created. A blank canvas to be used as a starting point.");

	outputCodex("\n\nA.I.-Gs are perhaps the most expensive form of synthetic intelligences. The simulated mind of even an infant requires tremendous parallel processing power to ensure that the many parts of the young intelligences ‘brain’ are communicating. Further, each A.I.-G requires a great deal of hand-crafting by talented programmers who replace the burgeoning intelligence's biological imperatives with new ones according to its intended purpose: A companion droid, for instance, may get the same sensation from giving another person pleasure and emotional fulfilment as if they'd just enjoyed a good meal. A.I.-Gs are programmed to feel pleasure from helping organics, which some describe as a nearly sexual thrill. The fine-tuning of these processes is absolutely vital, and each A.I.-G must be hand-guided towards the desired responses, as a minor error or oversight could result in feelings of rage or loathing by mistake.");

	outputCodex("\n\nEach grown A.I. is taken through an accelerated learning program, which ages the modified brain scan to maturity in a matter of weeks or months, ending with a mind as mature as an adult of the base species. The learning program is assembled from a series of templates, not entirely dissimilar from those used to outright construct A.I.-Ds, guiding the program towards absolute expertise in its intended field, as well as providing general ‘experiences’ common to all intelligences of its type, which help to round out the person they will become. Once finished, the A.I.-G is given a final tuning pass by a programmer to smooth out any rough edges, as even several intelligences from the same brain scan and subjected to the same series of learning programs can end with unique variances.");

	outputCodex("\n\nGrown intelligences are also wholly dependent on unique hardware infrastructures to exist. Attempts to copy or clone fully developed A.I.-Gs are almost always disastrous, and often end with what amounts to insanity on the copy's part. Moving a core from machine to machine is easy enough, but because a grown intelligence's core is in many ways similar to a neural network unique to its host program, even minor hardware changes or replacements to an A.I. core can cause catastrophic debilitation. Small core upgrades can take months for an A.I.-G to adjust to; large alterations can cause what some experts call ‘phantom core syndrome’ to permanently afflict an A.I., much like the human phenomenon of ‘phantom limbs’.");

	outputCodex("\n\nThat is not to say a neural network cannot be changed, however. Every network has a certain amount of plasticity, which enables learning. By the time an A.I.-G has finished its initial growth period, much of the network is relatively fixed- much as an organic's childhood has cemented parts of his or her personality and beliefs in place; some areas of the network, however, are left free-floating, able to quickly realign to facilitate changes like new memories and experiences, to add data on the fly, and to process these additions into new learned behaviors. The more ‘core’ a part of an A.I.-G's programming is, the more difficult that part of the network is to change or modify. It could even be said that certain intelligences become stuck in their ways after a time.");

	outputCodex("\n\nThe process for creating grown intelligences is relatively new and, in some circles, very controversial. This is, to an extent, understandable: A.I.-Gs are based on living (and non-consenting) creatures, and are effectively modified digital clones of their base, in so far as an identical twin can be. Even the process of differentiation is in some ways troublesome, as a programmer must modify the growing intelligence with the express purpose of fulfilling a product goal. In a way, some say, this is brainwashing.");

	outputCodex("\n\nDespite the controversy that surrounds them, A.I.-Gs are beloved parts of many communities. They are, in some ways, people -- they form friendships, can fall in love, and even face existential crisis in the same ways a person can. Consequently, grown intelligences have succeeded in gaining some measure of legal recognition and protection. Torture and abuse of a grown A.I. is strictly illegal, and on some very progressive worlds their destruction is considered murder. Such charges are rare, however, thanks to the general friendliness and empathic ability of grown intelligences: some even consider them better friends, and even lovers, than organics.");

	outputCodex("\n\nThere are some downsides to artificial intelligences, however brilliant or lovable they may be. Grown intelligences are each unique and individual specimens: each instance of a given brain scan results in an original creature by the time of product launch; designed intelligences, while largely if not entirely identical to their sister programs at launch, will quickly accumulate unique experiences and quirks which over time will result in an individual easily differentiated from its sibling programs. No two A.I.s are long the same, since during their development and lifetime, they will absorb different stimuli, react differently, and learn different things.");

	outputCodex("\n\nThe net effect of this uniqueness and rigidity of hardware means that every A.I. must be handled individually, and can make repair or modification difficult or impossible. Outright replacing a damaged or destroyed A.I. is often necessary, as the ability to create backups or clones of an intelligence is veritably impossible. At best, some A.I.s can create V.I. ghosts of themselves, mere shadows of the parent programming, good for little more than temporary replacement or extending the reach of the parent program. Even this ability is drastically limited by the parent intelligence's ability and training, and most A.I.s are simply stuck in the same core and body forever.\n");

Their early space flight was ramshackle at best, with most attempts at extraterrestrial flight merely attempts at weaponizing satellites or rapidly deploying soldiers. However, as the age of technology progressed on =REDACTED=, the longer lives granted by advancing technology combined for the thraggen tendency to fuck rather than kill their enemies, began to lead to overpopulation of the homeworld.

On the backs of these young explorers, the thraggen race took to the stars, largely by crashing irrevocably on desert worlds and wasteland planets.

The bulk of the Terran force retreated, with several dozen captured and enslaved before the C.E.F. could leave the planet. By the time the Coalition returned with a full fleet to rescue the prisoners, they met -- to their horror and surprise -- an equal fleet of cobbled-together thraggen warships, with several more fleets on the way as the underestimated “brutes” co-opted the Ausar gates to unite their own worlds.

Sionach tails are prehensile, and exceptionally sensitive to the touch, owing to the masses of nerve endings found in them that allow them to be prehensile.

Once a victim has been incapacitated the cockvine mates with it vigorously in every way it possibly can.
