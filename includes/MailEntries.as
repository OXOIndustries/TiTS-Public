	Each of the arguments (after the key) to addMailEntry can either be a string,
	or a function.

	Strings will simply be presented as required - use strings where possible, but,
	keep in mind that you can do NOTHING dynamic with them. Not even the parser.
	Raw strings aren't saved, because there can never be any room for them to
	vary from player character to player character.

	Functions will be executed when the entry itself is considered unlocked.
	This will effectively 'capture' the state of the game at that point in time,
	allowing dynamic things to be incorpoerated.
	The result of these functions are cached and will be saved to the players save
	file.
	Functions must take no arguments and return a raw string. If you're using tags,
	this means the function has to manually call parser.doParse(msg) at some point.

	You can mix and match methods in the same mail. F.ex use strings for everything
	but the "To" argument to present it as "Mr. Steele"/"Mrs. Steele"

	You can jam functions into this file in a similar ilk to CodexEntries, but for
	shorter snippets it might be an idea to get handy with inline function declaration syntax:

		MailManager.addMailEntry("someEntry", contentFunc, function():String { return (pc.hasCock() ? "Dudebros" : "Nondudebros"); }, "Some Name", ...);
