Rhapsodizing light shows accompany their inhumanly graceful movements, and it seems that for every man or woman that departs the stage, there’s always another to take their place.\n\nHeading south, you could make your way to <i>Treasure Nova’s</i> galaxy-class bar, or move on to more attractions in the east and west.";
