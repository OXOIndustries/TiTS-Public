Truth be told, you’d have thought McAllister would have thought of it first. <i>“Well... I suppose you could. That would be a custom job, though, not just mirroring an existing species. Takes a little more work, you know. Although I suppose the myr probably </i>were<i> one race originally, split off several millennia ago. If that is in fact the case, hybridizing their genetics shouldn’t be that difficult. I did notice an overwhelming similarity between the two while I was working, too...”</i>");

Instead, you spend a few minutes explaining your take on your meet and greet with his two test subjects: that you saw a red and gold myr making love like they were the best of friends. No coercion, no drugs, nothing but sex-drive and passion brought them together. That, and a little gene work by Doctor McAllister.");

Think you can show these myr how moronic their little war is if they see just how similar they really are? Eh, that’s a very... simplistic take on things, don’t you think? As someone who’s spent several weeks in the company of gold myr queens, the local politics are a little more complex than that, I assure you.”</i>");

Mostly because I couldn’t do it on Xenogen’s time; I’ve got other responsibilities with the company now that the two main myr transformatives are finished, and more than one of my superiors are starting to talk about moving me to a lab on another world already. I’d effectively have to rent my own lab space from the company.”</i>");
