/*NAME EXPLANATION/NOTES
Lyralla smiles. <i>“She is Queen Irellia Ildris Nere vas Uldred.”</i>
Irellia - Queen name. Chosen.
Ildris - Assigned name.
Nere - Mother’s name.
vas Uldred - vas indicates a dwelling or location. Essentially that her headquarters is based in a place called Uldred.

Assorted Body Notes:
Four honey-dripping titties
Bigass abdomen with egg-gaped pussy at the back that frequently lays.
Frontcunt between her legs. Paid a fortune to get it modded in. Was risky due to inexperience with myr genetics.
Longish antennae
Chitin painted blue, skintone gold/orange.
Blue lipstick
11’3”</i> tall at her full height. Queens get big.
Eyesight is poor. Has glasses, but don’t they don’t help much.

Other notes:
Was low ranking, but is climbing in power rapidly. Outbirthing other queens in her age group now.
Spends a lot of time breeding (a necessity of her job).
Bullied as a child for her small stature. Becoming a Queen changed all that, of course.*/
