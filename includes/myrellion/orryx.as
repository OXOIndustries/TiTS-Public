//Orryx - Sugar and Spice
//Orryx is a non-sexual encounter in Gildenmere. He’s a merchant with a very loud, conspicuous stand. The myr won’t do business with him, so he asks the PC to be his proxy. Initially, he simply wants the PC to collect 5 units of honey a day for him. If the PC works continuously with him, he begins to offer the PC the Red Myr venom.

//Background:
//Toves: 
//Orryx is a member of the Tove race, a mercantile species that resemble muppets. With six limbs, plush bodies, and a radically different reproductive system, they are sexually incompatible with most species. Evolutionarily, they’ve been civilized for so long that monetary prowess has supplanted typical sexual drives for them. Attraction is based on wealth, as is their government and social caste system. (Think Ferengi + Rygel from Farscape)

//The Camarilla: 
//Formerly the GGC (Madam Brillig’s information is out of date due to being stranded for so long), the Camarilla is the central government of the toves. Acting as a pan-galactic corporation, it encourages the participation of individuals by means of buyable votes. Camarilla policy is decided by the majority of votes, and votes are purchasable from the Camarilla. Smaller policy changes usually result in cheaper costs for votes, while major decisions often cost millions of credits per vote. For a tove to effect change in his/her government, he/she must first accumulate a sizable fortune.

//Ships: 
//Orryx’s podium is a Sponsorstand, so called because Orryx pays relatively little for it, so long as it can advertise freely on its exterior. In Camarilla classifications, it’s a Skimmer-class ship, barely more than a self-propelled pod. It possesses relatively few conveniences, save for a minor Aetherspace Bender, which creates slightly more room inside than out (its interior is roughly the size of a studio apartment, filled with water). Orryx makes heavy use of its Aetherspace Manifestor, hydraulic compressor, which keeps the interior of the podium both filled with water and at deep-sea levels of pressure. Orryx makes heavy use of his Seeders, a pair of small, long-range transport rocket-pods that propel themselves into low orbit and connect to the nearest Camarilla trade route. With only two Seeders, he can’t move much product in the course of a day. Orryx references “wabeships,” the highest class of Camarilla ship--massive, dome-like pleasure satellites, owned by the most prosperous toves.
