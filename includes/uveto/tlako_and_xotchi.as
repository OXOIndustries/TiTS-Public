Kalocrunch
Kalocrunch - This Camarilla-brand high-calorie snack food might be delicious, but is probably terrible for you. The silver packet displays a picture of a happy kui-tan stuffing her cheeks with tiny shapes. The "crunch" comes from the fact that it’s a blend of salt, solidified fat, and crystallized sugar. Now in Teriyaki!
	You crunch down on a mouthful of geometrically-shaped Kalocrunch, moderately surprised at the burst of flavor across your tongue. You wouldn’t say it’s delicious--it’s salty and sweet and crunchy at the same time. But despite that, you keep eating until you’ve finished the bag. You’re not particularly proud of yourself, and that probably wasn’t good for you, but you are immensely satisfied.

//Yibb-Tstll’s Reflexive Lube
//Yibb-Tstll’s Reflexive Lube! - This Camarilla-brand lubricant is applied as a suppository and is supposedly "Good for What Rails You!" The small, green capsule bears a picture of a tove with four thumbs up and an unsettling grin across his face. It will help you accommodate larger insertions at your backdoor. 
//	Use: You push the small, green capsule into your rear, feeling it slip surprisingly well into your bud. It dissolves instantly, bringing a slippery, lubed feeling to your asshole. That was... weird, but it seems to have worked.
//	[+2 to Anal wetness for 3 days]

//YTRLube

//Thermal Pack
//Thermal Pack - This disposable device is roughly the size of an egg. Upon activation, it emits a microwave field around you to protect you from some of the negative effects of the cold. It probably can’t handle the deep freezes of a snowstorm, though.
//	Use: You squeeze the top and bottom of the silver egg together. With a soft hum, it begins to float slowly around you, orbiting you like a tiny moon. Around its center, a red ring glows brightly, bathing you with a mild heat.
//	[Negates Freezing Cold Damage for 24 hours]
