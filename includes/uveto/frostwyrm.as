It’s not everything you wanted, but the thunderous pleasure that crashes through you erases any sense of deprivation. Conscious thought gives way to cries of animalistic pleasure, followed by orgasm as the wyrm hammers you, filling you utterly and completely. Your head lolls back, insensate as you climax around the beastial member.");
		output("\n\nThe wyrm follows you a mere moment later, bellowing a triumphant roar as its cock swells with impending need. You have but a moment to brace yourself before the flood of cold, sticky wetness floods into you, bloating your gut as a monstrous load of wyrm-spunk takes root.");
		output("\n\nAfter a long minute, the frostwyrm withdraws from you with a wet, resounding squelch. The moment it does, you feel like you’re a balloon deflating with gallons of spunk leaking out of your abused hole. The sensation is as frightening as it is amazing.");
		output("\n\n<i>Hmm,</i> the wyrm’s voice coos in your mind, sending shivers of pleasure through you even as the creature’s body moves off of you, and its claws wrap around your limp frame. <i>You will serve. Yes... a fine mother for my brood indeed. Now rest. We must ensure your body plays home to many fine eggs once you recover.</i>");
		output("\n\nYou nod meekly as your captor carries you back to the cavern’s edge, and reattaches your chain to its pedestal. <i>Now rest,</i> it repeats, and you begin to feel your eyes becoming leaden. You drift off to sleep, completely content in the tight hug of your collar around your neck, a constant reminder of your servility.");
		output("\n\nYou can’t wait to be a mother to such magnificent creatures.");
