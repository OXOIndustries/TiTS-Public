As you can probably see, Uveto is a totally hostile world. I can barely, like, feel any of my limbs and I’m wearing three heat belts! Because it’s so cold and stormy, and the natives remain resistant to uplifting, there’s been very little proper study done here on the frozen moon. But we’re here to change that!”</i>");

Under the light of the massive gas giant in the heavens, the whole moonscape seems to take on a reddish-white hue. Pretty, in its way, but also as foreboding as a blood moon. Steph wraps her arms around herself and starts creeping forward. <i>“So today, we’re on the hunt for a Korgonne! They’re a cute little race of caniforms, fluffy and pudgy as they come, but super fierce when provoked. I’ve gotta be slow and careful if I don’t wanna end up bushwhacked and dragged off to who-knows-where. Remember: if you get stuck or lost out here, you’re on your own gettin’ back!”</i>");

Aww, they’re so cute! We must be gettin’ close to korgonne territory now, see?”</i>");

With that done, the aggressor laughs and flops onto his ass, grabbing Steph’s feet and locking them around his own dick and starting to jack off with them. Consolation prize.");
	output("\n\nThe camera drone buzzes around, sweeping from one side of the vigorous gang-bang to the other. Several bare furry asses are pounding away at Steph, making her ample curves jiggle obscenely. She moans and gasps, bucking against the many bodies writhing overtop her. Her tail, at least, seems quite happy with its predicament, thrusting deep into the unlucky dog-boy’s ass to the same rhythm that he’s pounding his knot over and over into Steph’s pussy with.

Her hips wiggle and thrust back against the dick trying and failing to knot her, right up until the poor pup grunts and shudders, and the camera drone dutifully zooms in to watch a waterfall of creamy white spurt out around his knot. Steph gasps and giggles, reaching down to pet the korgonne between his low-tucked ears... until she gets distracted by a sudden eruption of puppy-cream between her soles, and then another into the pillowy depths of her cleavage.

She’s moaning softly, breath coming in erratic, steamy mists as she brings herself to a shuddering, voyeuristic climax.
