//Tuuva: Korgonne Blacksmith
//By QuestyRobo

/*
//Frostbane Plate
//Short: FrostPlate
//Description: A suit of heavy plate mail, woven from frostwyrm scales and metal plating, and padded with heavy hides and furs.
//Tooltip: A suit of white dragon scales woven with thick, metal plates into heavy, protective plate mail. Several layers of fur and hide line the entire inside, filling in any holes in the joints. It’s not what you’d call maneuverable, and would only be sexy to a medieval cavalry fetishist, but that’s not really the point.
//Defense = 11
//Evasion = -5
//Sexiness = -2
//Fortification = 30
//Resistances:
//Freezing = 50%
//Burning = -20%
//Nullifying

//Frostbane Mail
//Short: FrostMail
//Description: A suit of white scalemail, woven from frostwyrm scales.
//Tooltip: A suit of white scalemail overtop a thick, hide jacket. Lightweight and maneuverable, while also providing a good deal of protection, especially against the cold.
//Defense = 8
//Resistance
//Freezing = 25%

//Frostbane Bikini
//Short: FrostBkini
//Description: A sling bikini made from frostwyrm scales and strips of fur hide.
//Tooltip: It’s hard to believe that you used the scales of a legendary creature to make a sling bikini, but here you are. A split strip of sleek, white dragon scale, held together with fur hide, that has just enough material to cover your [pc.crotch] and [pc.nipples] and barely a few inches more.
//Defense = 3
//Sexiness = 8
//Evasion = 10

//Affection
//Tuuva has a basic affection system that scores from 0-100.
