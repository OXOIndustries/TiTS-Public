	outputCodex("\n<i>A temporary bimbo transformation drug enters the market. Chris’s girlfriend tries it out in front of him.  Explicit.</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nChris’s girlfriend had found out about his fetish. He felt terrible. But what made him feel worse was that Tess wanted to try it out.");
	outputCodex("\n\nNow objectively, this was a great thing. After hours of watching girls high out of their minds and swollen up on B or bim-bips or BXBI, Chris was finally going to see it in real life.");
	outputCodex("\n\nBut just listening to Tess talk about how they would approach tonight responsibly sent all sorts of guilty knots through his stomach. Tess was slim, with a strong air that made her seem to take up more space than she really did. She wouldn’t be out of place in one of those videos he watched. The girls usually started out safely cute, even a little tomboyish, like her. If you were making a video, you wanted to show off the change, you know? Same reason why they weren’t usually blonde already like she was, with her short head of hay-blonde hair.");
	outputCodex("\n\nMaybe the problem was that he loved her. He’d tried explaining that he didn’t need this sort of thing from her, that she was already enough to make him happy. She hadn’t believed him. At least, she hadn’t believed that he wouldn’t enjoy this.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“So I looked up BXBI to see the dosage,”</i> she continued.");
	outputCodex("\n\nChris grasped the inside of his pockets and looked out the window of their apartment. Just hearing Tess say the name of the drug upset him. It was something he heard in porn, not from her.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“What I got is way more than enough. If it works out for us, we’ve got a whole month of fun,”</i> she said. She shook the bottle of BXBI pills and stifled what sounded like a giggle.");
	outputCodex("\n\nHe recognized that sound. Chris lifted his head to look at Tess. She was biting her lip and visibly holding back laughter. Tess had to be playing a prank on him with this. His anxiety wouldn’t accept any other explanation. He said, <i>“You didn’t already–”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess let out her giggle. <i>“I took some in the car. It’s acting kinda fast though. Supposed to take thirty minutes but it’s been only like, twenty,”</i> she said.");
	outputCodex("\n\nFuck. Chris had wanted to convince her not to take it. To watch a few videos together with him, instead of taking things as far as they could go on the first night. She was feeling the first giddy blush of being a bimbo already. Chris wasn’t sure how he felt.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Look, maybe we should just stick you in the bedroom and let you ride it out,”</i> he said. <i>“You don’t want to do something you’ll regret while you’re high.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess pushed a handwritten piece of paper into Chris’s hands. It read: <i>“Limits: No permanent alterations (i.e. tattoos), just the two of us, no taking pictures, no other drugs.”</i> On the bottom, Tess had signed it.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Anything you want to add?”</i> she asked.");
	outputCodex("\n\nDamn, she had planned this whole thing out. She’d even written that sheet out in advance. Chris set the paper down. <i>“I don’t want to do this. It’s kind of a...corruption thing...”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess rolled her eyes. <i>“And what, you think I’m too pure and delicate for a little fun? Just give it a chance, you–oh!”</i> Her eyes went wide and her shoulders stiffened.");
	outputCodex("\n\nChris was sweating. He should be enjoying this. He was going to regret enjoying this. He was going to regret not enjoying this more. Tess’s chest pushed at her shirt, making the fabric shift in short spurts. The videos always made it look smooth, but in real life, without a spandex shirt, the fabric slipped and stopped and wiggled, then stretched and slipped again. What was the same was the weight, the way that her chest tugged her shirt down, pulling the neckline with it. The size, too, how her breasts seemed to occupy more of the width of her chest, how gap of her cleavage shrank bit by bit.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Do you know what it feels like?”</i> Tess asked. Chris stared. She didn’t look the same with larger breasts. They softened her; they took away from her strong shoulders.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess giggled and dragged her fingers down over her shirt. The fabric desperately stretched over her chest, but as hard as the shirt pushed, her chest pushed back harder. She was up two cup sizes by now. Her cheeks were flushed light pink.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“It’s like honey-sugar-cinnamon,”</i> she said. <i>“It’s warm and sticky, but then sometimes it feels almost like something firm, like crunching a mouthful of sugar, and then when it hits your skin, it tingles.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nChris’s mind answered before his conscience stopped him. <i>“BXBI is silicone-based, that’s why it feels the way it does.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess licked her lips. <i>“Come on, tell me what’s going to happen.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nThe core body was the first to feel the effects, followed by the head, then the extremities. Some people tuned out after the tits, but not Chris. He could watch a girl changing all the way through. So why did it feel so strange to see this now, in real life?");
	outputCodex("\n\nChris shook his head. <i>“No,”</i> he said, <i>“we need to get you somewhere safe. If you’ve got a vibrator...”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nShe grasped the bottom of her shirt and tossed it over her head. Her pale-blue bra squeezed the underside of her breasts. They were perky, forced upward by the bra, and yet they looked wrong on Tess’s frame. They didn’t look like hers, like they were fake. And in the sense of being pumped up with silicone, they were fake.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Get this bra off me,”</i> Tess said. She lowered her voice, but her natural pitch was rising, so she only sounded more sultry than before.");
	outputCodex("\n\nChris shook his head again. Below Tess’s bust, her stomach gently pinched in, like someone had just lightly squeezed her sides. Or like a corset, tucking her waist inward. He’d never had a single problem with Tess’s weight, but he had to admit, a slimmer body highlighted her hips and the natural curve of her abdomen more.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Chris! Get this fucking bra off!”</i> Tess groped at her back, trying to grab the clasp. Her skin had turned pink where the straps dug into her sides and her back. She turned his back toward him, shoulders hunched, leaning forward.");
	outputCodex("\n\nChris was stunned for a moment. This was another thing that never came up in his videos. They must have used tear-away bras that were meant to rip off. He stepped up and wrapped a finger around the clasp, but it was pulled too tight to come undone. He tried tugging the straps. Tess groaned, and not in a pleasant way. Chris was blushing violently. He was embarrassed about enjoying this, about not enjoying this, about ruining the mood because he was incompetent with bras. He grabbed the scissors from the kitchen counter. With two snips, Tess was free.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess breathed in deep relief. Chris lifted off the remains of her bra.");
	outputCodex("\n\nHe grimaced and said, <i>“Sorry, I know it was your favorite.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess shrugged. The motion jostled her breasts together. They wobbled slightly, but kept their rounded shape. For a moment they parted, then met with a small bounce and a sharp breath of surprise from Tess.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess’s breasts didn’t look like they belonged to her. They were heavy and they jutted out proudly. They sagged only slightly, like they made one concession to the fact of gravity, to make up for their otherwise taut look. As she moved, she brushed her arms against the sides of her breasts, then squeaked and wrapped one arm around her chest to cradle them. They were more tender than she had expected. From her elbow to her fingertips, she just barely managed to cover the front of her chest. They weren’t quite as large as her head, but the size wasn’t that far off.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“It’s cool. Think we can go shopping for a new one?”</i> she asked. <i>“Like, I really wanna go to the...mall.”</i> Tess’s eager expression softened in surprise, then returned bright as ever. <i>“Wow! It’s so easy to talk like that I didn’t even notice it, but it’s like, this little teeny warm feeling in my head,”</i> she said.");
	outputCodex("\n\nIf she was starting to get high off the BXBI, Chris didn’t have a lot of time left to reason with her.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“I really appreciate that you want to do this for me, but I think you should just wait it out in the bedroom. I’ll go to a sex store, get you anything you want,”</i> he offered.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess rubbed the underside of her bare belly, with only the slightest natural bulge to it. Her expression slowly glazed over. <i>“It’s dripping down, down, down...and it’s so warm and it’s getting all over my insides.”</i> She reached out and wrapped her arms around Chris’s neck. <i>“I want you,”</i> she told him.");
	outputCodex("\n\nChris’s hands instinctively went to her hips. Her skin was soft. She shivered eagerly. Her body was warm, the way she felt warm on winter mornings, when they both stayed beneath the sheets and tried to see how long they could hold each other before they had to get up and eat.");
	outputCodex("\n\nNow her hips were softer, letting his fingers sink in slightly. They curved so that his hands slipped toward her ass. They guided the eye up and down, inviting anyone who looked to stare all they wanted. Even if her hips didn’t feel familiar, he couldn’t stop himself from rubbing his hands up and down her sides.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess pressed her chest against Chris. Her breasts gave way, but they weren’t soft. They squeezed, but they kept their shape. Though they flattened against his chest, pressure from inside kept them rounded as they grew. These weren’t his girlfriend’s breasts, but they were ideal fake tits. They’d really pop in a bikini, or a tank top, or strapless dress. As thoughts thoughts crossed his mind, Chris felt embarrassed and excited in equal measure.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“I thought you liked fake boobs,”</i> Tess said, pouting to tease him. <i>“Betcha I can’t say a cute me-so-silky–mesosillyco-jenny-sis.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nAcute mesosilicogenesis, ‘the temporary development of silicone within specific adipose tissue’, was one of the hallmarks of BXBI. Chris knew it, but he didn’t say it. Tess didn’t need encouragement. She was having fun, but Chris couldn’t tell if this was an act for him, or if she was really enjoying it.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Tess, you’re embarrassing yourself.”</i> Chris’s cheeks blushed violently.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess smiled. Her lips were plush and so kissable that it took conscious effort from Chris not to. <i>“There’s no one here but you, me, and your cock,”</i> she said.");
	outputCodex("\n\nShe paused a moment, then laughed out loud.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Ohmigawd, that’s so dirty! Like, does it really make you do that?”</i> She got a thoughtful look on her face. Her eyes trailed down from Chris’s anxious brow and pursed lips, down to his chest–and her own, as her deep silicone-engorged cleavage was shoved up against him.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“These are my...tits,”</i> Tess said. She snickered. <i>“Titties! Boooo-bs. The smart word doesn’t even, like come out in my head.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nAll of that guilt that Chris had forced down every time he watched a video of a girl going bimbo, all of it swelled back up in his chest. He was anxious and horny and a little upset. He wrapped his arm around Tess and tugged her, trying to be gentle but firm.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“I don’t care what you say, I’m going to make sure you ride out this thing safely,”</i> he said.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess’s lips swelled and pulled the skin taut. From the glisten on her lips, she’d put on lip balm in the car. It was supposed to be good for your first time; it let your lips grow more freely. Her lower lip was rounded, curling outward as it grew, getting closer to her chin. Her upper lip swelled out, rounded too. At the top it pinched in slightly, following the upper contour of her lips. Still, the shape was stretched out into rounded, plush excess. The plumpness of her lips forced them to stand out from her face. They were a plump O, parted lightly in the middle.");
	outputCodex("\n\nA lisp whispered among Tess’s words. They were thick enough to make moving them to speak challenging. <i>“These are really...uh, they feel really good,”</i> she cooed. Her voice was higher still; she squeaked a little, with a bubbly, energetic tone. She pressed two of her fingers against her lower lip and made a soft sound of delight. With the same two fingers, she rubbed along her lips. A shudder ran through the great pillows of her chest and the thick handrests of her hips.");
	outputCodex("\n\nHer fingers slipped into her mouth; her eyes fluttered. She slid them in and out, experimenting with the motions. With Chris’s arm around her, he could feel when a particular press or push of her tongue made her shudder or made her tense her back.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Please, stop doing that with your lips,”</i> he said. He didn’t want Tess to get distracted already. At the same time, he was worried she might get a kick out of being ordered around as a bimbo.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess popped her fingers out of her lips with a wet splop.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“They’re cock-sucking lips, get it right. Woah, hee hee, now that’s dirty!”</i> she chuckled. <i>“But it’s like...umm. I wanna tell you how my lips feel but it’s hard without knowing, y’know, good words.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nChris gulped to wet his throat. He pushed Tess toward the bedroom as she babbled in her new, glittery voice.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“But, umm. You know when you’ve been standing up for so long? And it’s like, you really wanna lie down? So then you lie down in bed and it feels good no matter how you do it? Like just doing it’s the best thing ever right now? That’s how it feels. I bet it’d feel so much better with the real thing though,”</i> Tess said.");
	outputCodex("\n\nHer hand slipped toward his crotch. Chris turned to keep her from grasping it. He didn’t need her to know that he was getting hard. He was already upset that Tess was going through this for him. She didn’t need to! He wasn’t getting off on this. He just needed to keep telling himself that. Maybe that would make it true.");
	outputCodex("\n\nHe pushed Tess into their bedroom and stood in the doorway. She took a few steps to catch her balance. With a hazy, distracted look in her eyes, she grabbed her pants, unbuttoned them, and pushed them down. When she leaned over, her breasts swung down beneath her and bounced together briefly. They held their shape, even when she was bent over. Mesosilicogenesis, Chris thought. Big, fake porn star tits out of nowhere. That’s what they were. Tess kicked off her pants and stood up straight. For a moment, her breasts kept moving. They bounced upward as she straightened, then jiggled back into their proper place. Her breasts turned any motion she made into a sexual display.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess’s lips, swollen to a tender and vulgar size, drew in Chris’s eyes when he looked at her. She stared straight ahead as she pressed two fingers between her lips. Her lips curled inward as she sucked. By the motion of her throat, she was keeping a slow rhythm. Her eyes went unfocused and her fingers disappeared up to her thumb.");
	outputCodex("\n\nChris should have closed the door. He stood in the doorway, watching. Tess’s stomach was no longer flat. Instead of the tucked, nearly anorexic look, she had a gentle bit of tone to her belly, like she took care of her body. Like she exercised her hips every day. Like she spent all her time grinding on–");
	outputCodex("\n\nStop it. Stop thinking about it.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess’s eyebrows perked and she pulled her hand from her mouth slowly. <i>“Wow. It’s like...all I could think about were my lips. It’s not not thinking, it’s like, my focus is all weird,”</i> she said.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess turned and walked to her dresser. Even from behind, the outer edges of Tess’s breasts were visible. They were simply that big. Like her stomach, her back was gently toned, though not to any athletic extent. She probably couldn’t even play beach volleyball, the semi-official sport of bimbos. What mattered was that her back was strong enough to hold her chest up.");
	outputCodex("\n\nChris let his gaze drift lower. He had already felt Tess’s soft ass, but seeing it all as one, ass and hips and waist, made it clear just how wide her hips had gotten. They were as wide across as her breasts were, like a line drawn straight down from the side of one tit would just graze across the side of her hips. Her body had a carnal symmetry.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Ugh.”</i> Tess exhaled so sharply, he could see her rolling her eyes. <i>“This makeup is lame,”</i> she said. <i>“And it’s weird, cause it’s my makeup, y’know? I know why I bought it.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nChris did too. Tess never liked to get dressed up. He didn’t mind. It was nice having a cute, low-maintenance girlfriend.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Chris.”</i> Tess’s tone was gentle, but serious. She looked up at him, pursing her obscene lips. <i>“When I’m back, you gotta get me to dress up and stuff.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nFor the first time, it crossed Chris’s mind that Tess’s tomboyish, unconcerned look might not have been intentional. He’d fallen in love with her like that, but hadn’t considered that it wasn’t the way she always wanted to look. Maybe she wanted to be prettier and more sexual. Maybe that was why she was doing this. Maybe he didn’t need to blame himself.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess stood up and turned around. She’d made do with what was in her makeup drawer, adding a sexual edge to the lip gloss and running eyeliner in thicker, more confident strokes around her eyes. Her usual light, natural look wouldn’t match the way she looked now. Her eyeliner was dark and flared at the corners to complement her thick mascara, while her mild blue eyeshadow added a bit more contrast. Her lip gloss only had a light pink tint, but with a couple applications, she’d reached a peachy-pink with a candy gloss shine.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Make me go shopping, and like, take me to a salon, kay? I’m telling you cause I’m way super shy about–oop!”</i> Tess moved to take a step, and her heel missed the ground entirely and she tipped forward.");
	outputCodex("\n\nChris rushed forward, arms out. Tess was heavier than he remembered. He caught her, arms under her shoulders. Her hands clung to his hips. She dropped to her knees in front of him.");
	outputCodex("\n\nBXBI could shorten the achilles heel in up to twenty-five percent of individuals, the Wikipedia entry in his mind told him. He couldn’t remember if Tess owned any pairs of heels she could wear for now. He glanced down at her. She was fidgeting quietly around his waist. His belt buckle jingled.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Tess!”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess sat back, her hands on his thighs, looking up at him. She giggled. <i>“Gawd, it’s like a big test and I gotta be ready so I can’t stop thinking about it. Like, it’s just there, and it doesn’t go away and it gets worse and worse. Like, I look at you and I can’t stop thinking about how you’ve got a cock and why I’m not doing anything with it.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nShe licked her lips. Chris had so many opportunities to turn away and shut the door, but the way Tess made it sound, it was like he’d be hurting her if he left her alone. Damn it. His body definitely appreciated what was going on, but he still felt guilty about liking this.");
	outputCodex("\n\nWhile Chris was distracted with his moral conflict, Tess tugged down his boxers and wrapped her fingers around the base of his cock. It swung up, heavy and warm and warmed further by her touch. Chris had words formed, but they melted when Tess’s lips parted and her tongue moved and the feeling of her overstuffed lips, her cocksuckers, enveloped him.");
	outputCodex("\n\nHer mouth knocked the wind from his lungs. Tess had given him head before, but this was different. Her lips was soft and tight and clung to his cock. Every time she pulled back, they tugged back along with her. They were so plush and glossy-smooth that he almost thought they might still be growing. Even just at their current size, Chris couldn’t deny it. Tess’s mouth was made for fucking. Sure, she could use them for other things, but her lips right now were sexual objects first and foremost.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess lifted her eyes and looked up at Chris. BXBI brought out blue pigmentation, but her eyes were already a drab, cloudy grey-blue. They lightened from the inside out, like little icy blue crystals. Even though the lustre of her irises made her look vacant, a cheeky twinkle still remained in her eyes. That playful look was just so Tess.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess’s tongue did things Chris had never known. It twisted around his shaft, it curled and slurped and danced along his skin. She dragged her tongue along the underside of his cock. She let go of the base of his cock and let her lips slide down until her forehead touched his stomach.");
	outputCodex("\n\nEvery inch of the way, she was sucking like it was her life’s work, like her whole worth lay in oral. He watched her shoulders and back tense, her thick, rounded ass rising and falling. He couldn’t see her breasts, but god, could he feel them. They sunk against his thighs, squeezing together, jostling for space between his legs.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess rose back, then sunk down onto his shaft again and again. Each time, the warmth was deeper, her throat pulling tighter, her sucking more desperate.");
	outputCodex("\n\nChris’s head throbbed. He felt weak in his knees and his stomach churned. His lower half seized and he felt a hot, sharp ache rise through him. His cock throbbed once, then spilled his load into Tess’s waiting mouth. She kept bobbing, an automatic motion, until the last spurt had left.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess slid off with a wet pop. She knelt on the floor, vapid eyes wide, cocksucking lips hanging open.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Ohmigawd,”</i> she said. Her voice had a vacant cadence, breathy and almost dizzy, like she was trying to remember a dream.");
	outputCodex("\n\nChris was blushing again. <i>“I couldn’t stop–”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Ohmigawd, ohmigawd. Cum is amayyzing,”</i> Tess said. <i>“It’s so, like, hot and wet and it goes down so easy and it tastes like cock which is super delicious anyway.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess dragged her finger across her lips, wiping up the small bit of cum that had spilled out. She slipped her finger into her mouth. With her other hand, she rubbed along her thighs and over her puffy mound.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“It’s...gawd, I can’t stop thinking about cum now! It’s all warm down my throat and in my belly. And there’s like, so many different tastes, when it first comes and the last drops and when it’s fresh and when it’s sticky. Ohmigawd I sound like such a slut, right?”</i> she asked.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess licked her lips. Her fingers pushed between her folds. She ground her hips against her hand, eyes rolled back, mouth hanging open.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“I just,”</i> she said between gasps, <i>“fucking love...cum!”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nA small splash of liquid fell to the carpet from between her fingers. Tess slumped against the side of the bed, red-cheeked. Even though Chris and Tess had always enjoyed sex, Chris had never seen her squirt before. It was too overtly sexual for Tess. This whole thing was too overt. The guilt rushed back in.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Ooh,”</i> Tess cooed. <i>“I think it’s gonna, like, do my brain now.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nChris had to clear his throat before speaking. <i>“I think it’s already done that.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess looked as thoughtful as she could, working her finger around a lock of her hair. <i>“You sure? It’s tingly and stuff up there.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Your–it’s your hair,”</i> he said.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess furrowed her brow and pouted. Then she saw the lighter strands of hair wrapped around her finger, and realization washed over her face. <i>“Ohhh. I thought it wasn’t gonna do anything, since I’m like, already blonde.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nBXBI could take a raven-haired brunette and leave them honey blonde. Tess already was blonde, but that wasn’t stopping the drug. Her hair was already lighter at the roots. Chris got to watch the familiar way that it trickled out toward the tips of Tess’s hair. The color leeched out of each strand. Her hair was pale, light, almost silvery. Platinum blonde fit the perfectly-fake BXBI look.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess scratched at her scalp and chuckled. <i>“It’s like tingly shampoo,”</i> she said. Tess shook out her hair, and each time it swayed, it swung back longer, reaching down further. The same process that bleached it also tamed its natural unruliness, leaving it softer and smoother and easier to style. By the time she’d shaken out her impeccably straight locks, they nearly reached to her ass.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“I’m gonna have like, so much fun with this,”</i> she said. She rose from beside the bed and walked, carefully on her tiptoes, to the mirror. She turned her head from side to side, grasping big handfuls of her amiably silky hair. <i>“It’s like when I played with Barbies, but now I’m the doll.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nWhile Tess tested out pigtails and ponytails in the mirror, Chris sat down on the bed to breathe. So much for locking Tess in the bedroom alone.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“You played with Barbie dolls? That’s not just the BXBI talking?”</i> he asked.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess clicked her tongue and rolled her eyes at Chris’s reflection. <i>“Uhh, yeah, I’m like, a tomboy, not a weirdo.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess combed her hair forward with her fingers. It fell down over her face and she left it there while she searched for scissors. She tucked the pair of scissors underneath her bangs, and trimmed them straight across, just above her eyebrows. The tight cut gave her a pop-star look, albeit a faked-up, bimbo one.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“I think I wanna hit a salon,”</i> she said. She let her ass fall to the bed and she bounced in all the ways she shouldn’t have. Her breasts jostled together. Even her lips jiggled slightly. <i>“I wanna get some curls and pink dye and stuff.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nChris nodded. <i>“I get that doing this is important to you,”</i> Chris said. It had been a bit selfish to think she was only doing this for him. <i>“I want to be here for you, no matter what you’re like.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess smiled as much as her lips would allow and leaned forward. <i>“Wanna call me Titty Doll?”</i> she asked.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“No,”</i> Chris said, gently.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Fine, but I’m still your titty doll even if you don’t say it!”</i> Tess stuck out her tongue, though it didn’t reach very far beyond her lips. She lifted herself onto the bed and lay back, knees bent, her toes touching the sheets. She normally had a naturally light complexion, but already it looked as if she’d spent some time out in the sun. Her cheeks were warmer and her breasts and belly were tanned.");
	outputCodex("\n\nWith her platinum blonde hair carefully cut and her silicone tits sitting on top of her chest, thick enough that she could barely see him without lifting her head, Chris imagined she was a professional porn star. He could see it, too: tiny bikinis, fancy mansions, showing her tits for the camera, giving blowjobs on private planes. None of that was true, but if he didn’t know Tess wasn’t always a bimbo, he could have believed it.");
	outputCodex("\n\nAt the same time, she was definitely Tess. Even with her idealized features, he could recognize her, and even with all her inhibitions peeled back, her personality peeked through. She liked to tease him, after all, and that’s what this whole thing had been.");
	outputCodex("\n\nChris pulled off his shirt. He took a deep breath. He tried to relax. He didn’t, but he climbed next to Tess on the bed. He wrapped his arms around her. The tan made Tess’s skin feel warmer against his, or maybe that was just how excited she was. She curled into his arms and her chest lay against his. A flicker of delight ran through her eyes.");
	outputCodex("\n\nChris was going to say something about how he knew this was what she wanted and he’d do this for her. He breathed in, and was cut off by Tess giving him a tug against her chest.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Ohmigawwd, just fuck me,”</i> she whined in her pink bimbo-squeak.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThey could talk later.");
	outputCodex("\n\nChris tried to nestle in against Tess like usual, but no matter which way he moved, her breasts were there, firm, too big to squeeze against. As a compromise, he rolled onto his back, and Tess straddled him, laying on top of him, propped up by her tits like pillows.");
	outputCodex("\n\nHis hands were on her hips again and his cock was already hard. As Chris lifted his hips to thrust into Tess, he had to hold back a heavy groan. Reading ‘BXBI can cause genital restructuring’ on the internet was one thing. The unblemished, uniform perfection of a sex toy plus the reality of sex; the tiny motions, the warmth and wetness and clenching muscles and intimacy; that was something else.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess rose and fell on Chris’s hips. Her hair bounced in heavy waves. Her breasts wobbled with slow sloshes of silicone. The two of them began separated by just Tess’s breasts, but as Chris found a rhythm and as Tess tucked her knees up by his hips for support, she rose into the air. Soon Tess was sitting up straight, arching her back, showing off for Chris.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThere was a name for this position but it escaped Chris. They weren’t ‘doing’ positions. Neither of them could devote enough mental energy to consider anything beyond their own pleasure.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess let gravity aid her descent. She fell down over his cock, and he sunk deep into her perfectly-molded pussy. Every inch of her tightened and squeezed and he could see every inch written on her swollen lips and bright, blank eyes.");
	outputCodex("\n\nEvery physical sensation screamed utter bimbo, but in Tess’s breathless moans and hungry gasps, he could tell it was her. It was the sort of noise she’d made when they slipped into bed late at night, both exhausted and both horny.");
	outputCodex("\n\nRaw guilt clenched at the bottom of his stomach. Chris used the nervous energy. He arched his hips and held tight to Tess’s waist. She fell down over him and he rose up to meet her. Chris clenched his teeth. Each thrust was ferocious. He focused his anger and tension and pent-up lust into his sex and she let out a pink-tinted squeal.");
	outputCodex("\n\nHe was holding onto her too hard. He let go and raised his hands to her chest. She made a stifled, surprised sound and her eyes rolled back.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“G-gawd, more,”</i> she gasped.");
	outputCodex("\n\nHe stroked her breasts. He squeezed; the silicone pushing back against his fingers. He rubbed his thumb over her nipples until they were stiff and any touch made her gasp and whimper. Her breasts wanted to bounce free. Each time she fell down over him, they wobbled thickly in his palms. With their fake tightness, they couldn’t slip out of his grasp.");
	outputCodex("\n\nChris’s vision blurred. His eyelids fluttered and he curled his body. His shoulders pressed back against the bed, his hands holding onto her huge tits, knees bent, heels dug into the sheets.");
	outputCodex("\n\nFor a brief time, all he could feel was her weight. Her hips fell with perfect balance, pushing her thighs against his side. The weight of her body came down on top of him, thick and taut, pushing him down against the bed. Her breasts fell against his hands, far overflowing his grip, making his arms ache against their weight.");
	outputCodex("\n\nEvery last bit of Tess was made for sex. And he...");
	outputCodex("\n\nEverything came into focus as he orgasmed. His fingers tightened instinctively. Tess’s tits bulged in the spaces between his fingers. Her cocksucking lips were wide open; she was screaming. Her perfectly sculpted pussy clenched. Her muscles shook with strain, and he trembled just like her. Then hot and wet filled the space between them, and it filled Tess, and it kept going.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess dragged her tongue over her lips to wet them. She was the first to move, before Chris had even finished. Chris tried to follow her with his eyes, but he couldn’t catch how she switched from pussy to mouth so quickly. BXBI...something...flexibility? He was too exhausted to recall the facts. All he could tell was that Tess was fast, and still hungry for cum.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess slipped her lips around him again, working her tongue along his cock, sucking down the last few bursts of cum. She sucked until the last trace of his seed was gone, then pulled free with a plop. As she sat back on the bed, she dipped two fingers into her pussy, then brought her fingers to her mouth and sucked them clean, without batting an eye.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Like, I didn’t even think that my tits would be so...um, like that they’d feel so good. It’s like a tingly thing that goes straight down to my pussy. Gawd, I can’t think of any good words!”</i> She giggled, then shook her head, making her blonde hair shimmer before falling back into its silky straight locks.");
	outputCodex("\n\nChris didn’t say anything. It had been the best sex he’d had, no contest. He stared at her, panting quietly, not smiling but in quiet adoration.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“So, you wanna get cleaned up in the shower with me?”</i> she asked as she stood up on her tip-toes.");
	outputCodex("\n\nChris shook his head and tried to dampen his throat with a gulp. <i>“S-sorry, I need some time.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nHe couldn’t even see a difference between Tess going into the shower and Tess coming out. Both of them were faked-out, BXBI-doll perfect. He slid into the shower after her, and quietly enjoyed how the bathroom smelled like their sex.");
	outputCodex("\n\nChris tried to imagine what he’d do with Tess for the rest of the day. The BXBI wouldn’t wear off until the next morning, but he didn’t know if he had the energy to keep pleasing her. Maybe a movie that Tess wouldn’t have trouble following in her distracted state, he thought.");
	outputCodex("\n\nWhen Chris came out of the bathroom, he found Tess sitting on the bed. She had squeezed into an old tank top of hers that barely fit, leaving her nipples sticking into the fabric. She’d paired some blue tiger-stripe leggings she’d bought for an 80’s-themed party with a denim skirt she hadn’t worn in ages, and was wearing polished black formal shoes with a three-inch heel. Even in the least-coordinated outfit he could imagine, Tess couldn’t help but ooze sexuality.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“What’s up?”</i> he asked. Chris tugged on a new pair of boxers.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess smiled coyly. <i>“Well I was thinking like, maybe we could go to the mall?”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Wasn’t the second thing on your limits ‘just the two of us’? The mall is kind of public,”</i> he said.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess huffed theatrically. <i>“Like, I meant no threesomes or anything. I wanna go shopping so I have stuff to wear when I’m all bimboed. Have you seen what I’m wearing?”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nChris hesitated. It was easier to keep a controlled environment here in the house, and there was the question of what he’d do if anyone he knew saw him with this drugged-out bimbo.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“I know just the kinda outfits you li-ike,”</i> she sang.");
	outputCodex("\n\nChris’s face flushed. She’d found his porn, after all. She’d know all his weaknesses. He’d get to see her in snug tank tops and hip-hugging shorts and plastic heels...");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Okay! Okay, we’ll go to the mall.”</i> Half out of eagerness, half because he didn’t want to hear her keep talking about what she’d found. He was embarrassed enough already.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess smiled brightly and hopped to her feet. She teetered forward on her heels, then took a step backward to steady herself. Even three-inch heels weren’t high enough to counteract her shorter tendons. Chris tried not to get too excited thinking about what kinds of shoes she could try on.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Great! I just gotta grab my purse and stuff,”</i> Tess said, breezing by on her way to the living room.");
	outputCodex("\n\nChris sighed and rested his head against his dresser for a moment. Even as a bimbo, Tess was clever enough to keep pressing his buttons. No doubt that she was still his girlfriend, no matter how faked-out she was on bimbo drugs.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTess had just finished scooping her bottle of BXBI into her bag when Chris came out to join her, dressed casually and doing his best to smile.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Ready to go?”</i> he asked.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Yep, got everything!”</i> Tess chirped, patting the side of her bag.");
	outputCodex("\n\nShe swung her bag onto her shoulder as she followed him out the door. Her fingers slipped into her bag and her fingertips ran around the cap of the BXBI bottle.");

The promise of treasure had drawn hunters in from the realm over like moths to a flame. Literally, in the case of the winged, white-fuzzed young woman heading up the packed-dirt path to the foothills with hands shoved into her pockets, whistling a jaunty tune as she walked.");
	outputCodex("\n\nIn a land teeming with centaurs and dog-folk and graceful elves, the moth-like woman wouldn’t have drawn a second glance... save for the two-handed sword sheathed between her wings, and the fact that she was clad in dark breeches and scale armor from the waist down, but bare above. The tremulous globes of her breasts bounced with every step, mirroring the motions of the branching feelers growing from just above her elfin ears. More than once on her trip a passing merchant or mercenary would stop and stare, just long enough for Lusina to get flirtatiously close... and lighten their pockets a bit before she was on her way again.");
	outputCodex("\n\nGrinning to herself, Lusina ran a finger along the swollen mass of her coin purse. She’d only left her home in the forest a few days ago, and already had doubled her meager funds. <i>“Not a bad way to start an adventure!”</i> she laughed, letting the bag drop into her pocket and running a hand back through her snowy hair. <i>“Maybe this dragon will have himself a horde of treasure, just like in mom’s old stories. All mine once I’ve got his head!”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nThe thought of swimming in a sea of gold and jewels carried the buxom thief all the way to the roots of the mountains. From there, her wings carried her onto the winds and up the craggy mountainside. While every other hunter after the chieftain’s bounty was busy scrambling up the cliffs and scouring the labyrinthine valleys, Lusina merely took wing and fluttered towards the peaks. A dragon’s lair should be easy to spot from above, right?");
	outputCodex("\n\nThe weight of her blade, armor, coins, and cleavage made the ascent slower than the moth-girl would have liked, and twice she had to find an outcropping of rock to land on and catch her breath.");

From her angle, it looked to Lusina like she could reach down and step on the little villages and scattered tribes clinging to the foothills far below.");
	outputCodex("\n\nAfter her second break, and a few moments spent cursing the cold, she rose to her feet and slipped off the cliffside, letting her wings taste the air again and glide out into the open sky. In the distance she spotted a pair of blue-skinned giantesses clawing their way down from the frozen peaks of the mountains, then a female manticore taking flight from a hidden cave, her tanned body bare and glistening in the afternoon sun. Lusina waved, smiling at her sister in the sky... right up until the manticore’s black wings took her swooping down onto an unsuspecting canid ranger camping on the side of the mountain. She barreled him to the ground with an exultant roar, and Lusina’s eyes grew wide as the ranger’s armor was ripped asunder, and the manticore mounted him like a beast in heat.");

	outputCodex("\n\nThat first day in the mountains yielded nothing but frustration. The moon loomed large and blue in the darkened sky by the time Lusina gave up the hunt with a heavy sigh, gliding down to a small shelf of dusty rock and sprawling out on it. <i>“Stupid dragon,”</i> she mumbled to herself as she unstrapped her claymore’s sheath from her back and leaned the heavy, ancient blade against the sheer side of the mountain. Her armor followed, clattering to the ground around her until she was in nothing but her breeches and the patchy old blanket she pulled from her satchel.");

The dreams shifted again, to a wide canopied bed befitting her imperial majesty. Queen Lusina lay on her back, wings and legs splayed, fluff-clad digits digging into silken sheets as a nubile girl with bronze skin and breeding hips slid her hand into her majesty’s royal cunt, licking her way across Lusina’s clit until she sat upright with a scream of pleasure...");

	outputCodex("\n\nLusina gasped and squirmed, unable to get far with her pants hooked around her soaked thighs. A voice shushed her, and the fingers in her went rigid, relaxing, as if allowing Lusina to pull off of them... if she wanted. In that moment, though, the moth-girl’s eyes adjusted to the moonlit night, and saw a back of clenched, strong muscles and sweeping wings bent over her lower body. A thick, curling tail sprouted from the figure’s behind, coiling around Lusina’s leg with a warm, wet insistence.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“M-m-manticore,”</i> Lusina stammered between orgasmic shocks of pleasure.");

	outputCodex("\n\nLusina gulped, glancing between the amorous feline, the edge of the cliff bare inches away, and the sheathed blade just out of reach. <i>“No? Good,”</i> the manticore growled, planting both hands on Lusina’s tits and squeezing, hard enough to make the moth arch her back and let out a cry of pleasure that echoed through the mountains for miles around. She collapsed onto her back, squirming and moaning as the manticore’s tongue probed into her, fingers roughly massaging the heavy swells of Lusina’s breasts until the inverted tips of her pink nipples peeked out to rub maddeningly against the manticore’s soft glove of fur.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Be quiet,”</i> the manticore snapped between deep licks. <i>“You’ll wake my sisters. And I want you all to myself.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nThe thought of being sandwiched between three or four of the lustful felines made Lusina bite her lip, trying not to give voice to her pleasure. Another deep lick, circling the spasming walls of her pussy until the manticore’s face was drenched with Lusina’s juices, destroyed any hope of keeping her cries pent in. The manticore huffed, narrowing her crimson eyes at Lusina, though the view was blocked almost entirely by the moth’s heaving chest.");
	outputCodex("\n\nAfter a moment’s thought, though, a devilish grin formed on the beast’s lips and her inhuman body moved to better silence Lusina.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThe moth-girl gasped as her lips brushed against something hot, wet, and moving. Her eyes flicked open again, settling on the thick, bulbous head of the manticore’s tail, now pressed against her face. It looked like a black melon, almost, open at one end and showing a wet, pink depth ringed with dark nubs. Around the four-fold lips of the manticore’s tail, though, were rings of boney spikes that made Lusina’s heart skip a beat - the manticore’s tail was a weapon of battle and of passion, it seemed.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Lick it,”</i> the manticore commanded, savagely squeezing Lusina’s tits as if for emphasis. Lusina cursed, groaned, and forced her tongue out between trembling lips. The four folds of the manticore’s pussy-tail opened wide for her, latching around Lusina’s mouth and inviting her tongue to explore the depths of her captor’s tail. It was the manticore’s turn to shudder and purr, firm body suddenly seeming much more vulnerable as Lusina licked her way deeper into the deep passage of tail-cunt affixed to her mouth. The moth’s hand wrapped around the tail’s wriggling haft, pulling it down and into deeper throes of bliss.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Oh... oh goddess...”</i> the manticore purred, eyes rolling back in her head. <i>“I knew you were a good choice! That’s what I like... just like that!”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nLusina answered by wrapping her legs around the manticore’s shoulders, burying the feline’s head back into her drooling slit. She was getting close, so agonizingly close to climax... ecstasy drove her to lick faster, to urge the manticore on with more impassioned use of her tongue, rubbing it along every single cock-pleasing nub she could find in the shaft of her captor’s tail.");
	outputCodex("\n\nWith a ferocious growl, the manticore buried her tongue as deep into Lusina’s spasming twat as it could, searching out every tender spot until Lusina was screaming into the musky wet depths of her feline partner’s tail, body going wild with overwhelming sensation. Orgasm hit the moth-girl like a tidal wave, knocking her flat on her back and draining what little remaining of her will. She was a twitching, drooling, pussy-eating mess in the span of minutes, barely able to think of anything other than the swirling cat-tongue playing across the walls of her sex.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Good kitty,”</i> Lusina finally managed to gasp out between after-shocks of pleasure, running a hand through the manticore’s auburn hair.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThe manticore purred and stretched, sitting up from between Lusina’s numb legs and revealing a face soaked and gleaming with the moth-girl’s orgasmic juices. <i>“Kitty?”</i> she huffed, crawling up Lusina’s prone body until their breasts were pressed against each other, drawing another moan of arousal from the moth. <i>“You’re lucky you’ve got such a talented tongue...”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nLusina managed a smile and murmured, <i>“Shut up,”</i> followed by a long and tongue-filled kiss, letting the two beast-kin taste their sexes, still hot one each other’s lips.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThe well-sated moth fell back asleep, still lost in the hot embrace of her feline lover, dreams rife again with images of treasure and debauchery... and of an amorous manticore, the moth-queen’s personal chief pussylicker.... A girl can only dream.");
	
	outputCodex("\n\nLusina was up at the crack of dawn, strapping on scales of armor and affixing her blade to back as the first hint of the golden disc crested the distant horizon. She left the manticore sprawled out and sleeping soundly on the rocky outcropping where they’d spent their night of passion - though not before finding the aggressive kitten had a small pouch strung on her hip full of small gem shards and coins, which Lusina deftly pocketed. A fair trade for ambushing her in the middle of the night, she thought.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThe morning went in a haze, each hour blending into the next as Lusina swooped across the mountains, searching for any sign of a great firewyrm. She found nothing but more of the mountain’s monstrous residents: a blue-hued ice giant playing her harp in an ancient ruin, a pair of brutish orc tribes squabbling for dominance of a shallow vale, a weather-beaten creature of stone that tried to grab her out of the air and into its slavering maw.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Where are you, dragon?”</i> Lusina started to sing as the afternoon drew near. <i>“Come out, come out, wherever you are...”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nHours passed in searching, until Lusina was forced to land and rest her wings. She found a small, perfectly semi-circular ridge to plop down on, and set her back to rest against the smooth face of the mountain. With a heavy sigh, she fished her canteen out and drank deep, letting the mid-afternoon sun warm her bare skin. It would have been so easy to fall asleep again there, her body eager to make up for lost time in the arms of the manticore. Only the wishful echo of her dream, of swimming through a sea of treasure and enjoying all the pleasures such opulent and imperial wealth brought with it, kept Lusina’s eyes open.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThat, and a sudden rush of scalding-hot air blowing against her back.");
	outputCodex("\n\nWith a startled yelp, Lusina rolled forward and took wing, drawing the dagger off her hip as she spun around to see what she hoped to be the fearsome dragon. Instead, she watched as the smooth rock face slid back into the mountainside, and then with a grinding roar that made her ears ache, slid down to reveal a small, hidden passage beyond.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Holy shit,”</i> Lusina breathed, flying back onto the semi-circle of rock. Her breasts bounced as her boots touched down, and her insectile feels fluttered as hot wind blew them about. She warily peered into the dark passage, and saw that it led down into the mountain, through a tunnel so perfectly rounded and smooth that it could be nothing but the work of gifted hands and strong tools.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Dwarves, maybe?”</i> she mused, trading her dagger out for the two-handed blade  carried on her back. <i>“Or kobolds... and where kobolds go...”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Where dragons go, kobolds follow,”</i> her mother had taught her, what seemed like a lifetime ago. Lusina took in a deep breath, tightened her grip around her mother’s blade, and took a step past the threshold.");
	outputCodex("\n\nShe fell immediately.");
	outputCodex("\n\nA scrape echoed through the passage, then the grinding of stone, and suddenly Lusina was falling - fast and uncontrollable, so sudden she didn’t have time to think, only to react. She batted her wings, throwing all her energy into an emergency burst of strength that stopped her descent and left her fluttering inches over a pit of barbed spikes, gasping to catch her breath.");
	outputCodex("\n\nShe cursed, sighed, almost ready faint from fright. <i>“Goddess,”</i> she finally managed to breath, twisting her flight down another off to the side of the square crusty spikes, and setting down. Anybody without wings or quick enough reflexes with their spells would have been skewered. Lucky her. <i>“Definitely kobolds. Definitely.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nKobolds meant she was on the right track. The little scaly creatures worshipped dragons like living gods, and colonies lived off of great wyrms like symbiotes, cleaning and serving it in exchange for protection. A slave’s life, Lusina thought, but she could hardly blame them - it wasn’t that different between peasants and lords in her homeland, long abandoned.");
	outputCodex("\n\nTaking a deep breath to steady her frayed nerves, Lusina started down the side passage. Careful where she tread, now, and keeping her blade in a low guard ahead of herself, she followed the corridor down for what seemed like hours. No more traps presented themselves: clearly the designers were sure the first would be enough to keep anyone out, and the side passage would serve for easy looting of the bodies.");
	outputCodex("\n\nEventually, Lusina spotted a distant light ahead, a faint pinprick of gold against the darkness even her beast-kin eyes struggled to penetrate. Lusina’s pace quickened, carrying her towards the growing beacon of light until the lengthy tunnel gave way to an open chamber, not more than ten feet across, lit by a pair of torches held in knee-high sconces. A wooden door sat on the other side of the chamber, daring her to approach.");
	outputCodex("\n\nShe stepped up to it and tried the handle. The door didn’t budge. There was no lock for her to pick - not that she had any picks anyway - nor any sign of mechanism. Probably barred from the other side. Lusina sighed. She didn’t trust her strength to kick the door in, and...");
	outputCodex("\n\n...And the door opened of its own accord, revealing the face of a rather bewildered-looking kobold. The creature came up to maybe three feet high, including its tiny horns poking up above its smooth, scaly face. It blinked, squawked something in a language Lusina couldn’t understand, and went running down the passage it had just opened with its hands over its head.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Shit!”</i> Lusina screamed, hefting up her blade and charging in after it.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThe kobold lead her on a chase down through the warrens beneath the mountain’s flesh, deeper and deeper into the depths. It was faster than a creature of its size ought to have been, deftly dodging every swordswipe and grab the moth-girl made for it, until the two of them came bursting out into a huge, wide-open chamber set some five feet down from the tunnel’s ledge.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThe chamber was crawling with kobolds, over a dozen of the diminutive dragon-worshippers, gathered throughout the torch-lit hall. All were gathered around a dais in the chamber’s center, on which sat an opulent throne like that of a great king. Like one single-minded entity, every kobold in the chamber turned its head to face the tunnel Lusina and their comrade burst out of.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Skree! Skree!”</i> the kobold she was chasing yelled, leaping down into the chamber. A couple of the kobolds grabbed spears and daggers from their backs, but most started to... to waddle away.");
	outputCodex("\n\nIt took Lusina a moment to adjust her eyes to the brighter light, and to see the kobolds clearly. All but a few of the creatures had bellies bloated to almost obscene levels, huge plump things that were barely able to move around on their stumpy little legs. The ones still able to move freely quickly formed up protectively around the swollen creatures, gibbering and screeching at Lusina with as much menace as their tiny voices could command.");
	outputCodex("\n\nLusina faltered for a moment, wide eyes watching the swollen kobolds waddle away in a panic as the others jabbed their spears towards her. They were almost cute, these kobolds. Shaking the thought out of her mind, Lusina put her war face on and flew down towards the armed mass of kobolds, blade outreached towards the nearest of them.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThey broke immediately. One good thrust from her sword tore into the nearest kobold’s spear, breaking it when he tried to parry her. The others backpedaled, suddenly aware they were much shorter and weaker than she was; they scrambled back as Lusina swung her blade in an arc, clearing out some room to maneuver.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThe creatures squawked and squabbled at her, but made no move to attack her - all their efforts were spent retreating slowly, warding her back with their simple weapons when she got too aggressive. Behind them, their swollen kin stumbled away as fast as they could - slower than Lusina could walk. As they retreated, Lusina started to look closer at them: small, scaly, naked creatures that kept their hands firmly affixed to their bellies, protectively shielding their... their offspring. Lusina sucked in a sharp breath as she realized these were the females of the tribe: as flat-chested as their armed males, but all heavily swollen with eggs, their tiny twats naked in the torchlight.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“No way their eggs are that big,”</i> Lusina hissed under her breath, between spear-shattering swipes of her claymore that constantly drove the little reptiles back. Louder, she bellowed, <i>“Where’s your dragon, huh? Tell it to come on out!”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nAs if on command, a wall of heat hit Lusina’s back, and the meager torchlight in the cave was washed away in a brilliant jet of flame, as bright as the morning sun. The kobolds squealed and turned tail, tripping over each other to flee. Even Lusina was forced to flinch, ducking down over the gout of fire spilling over her head, close enough to singe her feelers.");
	outputCodex("\n\nShe spun around, brade raised to a high guard, ready to face down a bestial wyrm - a creature straight out of legend.");
	outputCodex("\n\nInstead, her eyes went wide as she stared down what at first glance was a woman. Pale and beautiful and nearly human... save for the furling wings behind her, the russet scales covering her lower limbs, and the pair of sweeping horns growing from her brow and back over her scalp. Dagger-like claws clicked across the smooth stone as the scaly woman strode towards Lusina, long legs bringing her dangerously near the warrior-moth.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThe woman was stunning. Ivory skin growing from crimson limbs, perfectly smooth and soft, with just a faint trace of firm muscle beneath. A simple brown cloth hung to her hips, garbing her down to the knees, but like Lusina the woman went bare-chested, proudly displaying a pair of breasts every bit as big, soft, and succulent as Lusina’s own. The moth-girl felt a sudden rush of arousal boil through her loins, hammering in her heart in the same beat her fear and apprehension did.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“What,”</i> Lusina gulped, taking a defensive step back. <i>“What are...”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nThe woman smiled, revealing a quartet of long incisors. Her thick tail swayed behind her, dragging along after her. <i>“I...”</i> she said, resting a scaled digit on the tip of Lusina’s claymore, <i>“am the dragon you just called out.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nLusina gasped and staggered back, out of the creature’s reach. The <i>“dragon”</i> tsked her tongue and followed her, backing the moth-girl up against the cavern wall. Lusina gasped as her back pressed against jagged, rough stone, leaving her nowhere to go. Opposite the dragon, the kobolds chittered and cheered, dancing around their spears as their mistress cornered their would-be attacker.");
	outputCodex("\n\nSeeing the moth’s back against the wall, the dragon-girl took another confident stride forward, placing herself easily inside Lusina’s reach, seemingly without a care in the world. <i>“You may call me Eryxienne,”</i> she purred, punctuating the thought with a breath that burst into a ball of flame in her hand, roiling and lapping at the air inches from Lusina’s nose. <i>“Now, was there something you wanted, little moth?”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nLusina stood transfixed, silent, eyes locked on the roiling flame held like a living thing in the dragon’s claws. It was a ball of rolling flame that seemed to dance between her fingers, drawing Lusina’s eyes back and forth, side to side. The dragon cooed after what might have been a moment or an eternity, tilting her horned head to the side.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“I guess what they say about moths is true,”</i> the dragon said with a smirk, curling her fingers around the flame until it was almost out of sight.");
	outputCodex("\n\nLusina blinked, putting a hand to her chest as if to steady her hammering heart. <i>“You’re not a dragon,”</i> she gasped, eying the semi-humanoid woman, following the curves of her hips and across a flat, pale belly and up to her heavy breasts, each tipped with a rose-red teat. Dragons don’t have tits, do they? <i>“The reward... it was for a dragon’s head.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nEryxienne smiled at that. <i>“Ah, that explains the hunters crawling all over my mountain. I suppose Chief Raythek took offense at my nightly visits with his daughters. Or at least, that one of them grew heavy with eggs. Still, it’s his fault for moving his tribe near my lair. He should have known we dragons demand certain privileges among mortals. Tribute, some wyrms might call it.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nLusina gulped down her fear and pulled her blade back from the dragon-girl’s claw, angling the silver-gray edge at her neck instead. Eryxienne made no move to stop her, except to unfurl her fingers from around the ball of flame burning in her hand. <i>“I could incinerate you with a sneeze, little moth. Don’t be crass.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nLusina fought to keep her eyes on the woman rather than her dancing flames. Eryxienne’s grin only widened on seeing Lusina’s resistance and she clenched her fist, smiting the flame out of existence. With fingers still glowing like embers, Eryxienne reached forward and grabbed the front of the moth-girl’s pants.");
	outputCodex("\n\nLusina winced, feeling heat spreading through her loins of a completely different type, and watched in awe as her pants burned away, leaving the cream-colored flesh beneath totally unblemished. <i>“What’re you... stop that!”</i> she barked as the last charred scraps of cloth fell away, leaving only her armor and boots to clothe her. <i>“Stop it and fight!”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Why would I fight you?”</i> Eryxienne laughed, running one of her too-hot claws up Lusina’s thigh, pretending as if there wasn’t a blade pressed against her throat. <i>“If you really wanted my head, moth, you’d have taken it. But I think we both know you’re not like those other hunters - a rogue, perhaps, but not a cold-blooded killer. Besides, I think you’re more lover than fighter.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nLusina’s eyes went wide as one of the wyrm’s long, clawed digits snaked its way around the lips of her cunt, still tender from the manticore’s ministrations the previous night. She looked down as the dragon-woman pulled back, rubbing a slimy mess of Lusina’s own excitement between her russet digits. <i>“See?”</i> Eryxienne cooed, stepping past the moth’s guard and close enough that her soft bosom brushed Lusina’s own, her stiff red nipples coaxing the moth’s pink buds out of hiding.");
	outputCodex("\n\nFlame lapped at Eryxienne’s tongue as it neared Lusina’s lips, breathing a whisper before pressing against the moth-girl’s trembling mouth. <i>“Go ahead and drop your blade. Let me take my tribute.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nHer will broke like a dam, spilling out a tidal wave of lust and fear and confusion into her mind. Lusina felt her hand let go of the sword, heard it clatter on the stone floor of the caver as she reached down and grabbed Eryxienne’s ass, fingers digging into the dragon babe’s soft, creamy skin. She opened her mouth, accepting the probing tongue battered against her lips, and found it to be slender and forked, moving with speed and grace that she couldn’t hope to match.");
	outputCodex("\n\nAs quickly as it started, though, the dragon’s amorous advances abated. Eryxienne stepped back, her tapered tail flicking the sword far away from them as she moved. The dragoness stopped just out of arm’s reach, slitted eyes wandering over the moth’s now-bare body, gleefully watching her tremble with excitement and stain her thighs with arousal. Eryxienne planted her hands on her hips, hooking her thumbs under the meager strong that held her skirt to her body, and tore it apart with a relish.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThe cloth fell limply to the ground, revealing toned thighs freckled with scales, leading up to a sex gleaming with the dragon’s own ardor, red lips parted ever so slightly as if begging for some probing mass to assert itself.");
	outputCodex("\n\nOvertop it, though, hung a throbbing red cock.");
	outputCodex("\n\nLusina gasped when she saw it. The dragon’s member stood nearly a foot, and not fully hard yet. It was animalistic in shape, tapered at the tip and growing thicker into a bulbous, purple base not unlike a canid knot. The base grew from just over the dragon-girl’s clit, a second pillar of pleasure growing from her serpentine sex, twitching with the beat of its owner’s draconic heart.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Like what you see?”</i> Eryxienne laughed, kicking away her torn skirt. She planted her legs wide apart, giving Lusina a good look at her hermaphroditic package, and started to fondle her breasts, lifting one up to her mouth for a lick. <i>“Come have a taste then.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nWhen Lusina didn’t immediately step forward, the dragoness rolled her eyes and grabbed the top of the moth’s head, planting her hand right between the sensitive stalks of Lusina’s feelers and pushing down. The moth fell to her knees, resting on her scale greaves as the dragon’s heft prick bopped her on the nose, rubbing its musky crown across her cheeks. She breathed deep of its intoxicating aroma, letting it burn into her memory. The odor was thick, as heavy as the prideful member producing it, yet tinged with sweetness - a feminine twist on a thoroughly  masculine erection that made Lusina’s heart flutter.");
	outputCodex("\n\nShe tasted it eagerly, opening her mouth to accept the dragon’s dick. That’s all she needed to do - all she could, with Eryxienne’s hand firmly grasping the crown of her head. The dragoness thrusted her hips in, letting her reptilian cock glide across Lusina’s tongue and batter against the back of her throat. The moth-girl swooned at the taste, hands falling to her own drooling sex when the first thick drops of salty pre graced her tongue.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Good girl,”</i> Eryxienne moaned, slowly rocking her hips in and out, letting her moth-like lover get used to her incredible size. Hard, she was just past twelve inches, disproportionate to her six-foot frame, yet feeling so right in Lusina’s mouth. The moth-girl found her lips wrapping around the swollen knot of the base, opening her throat for the dragon to fuck - an offer that was immediately accepted. The dragoness’s hips started to piston, battering at Lusina’s lips and smearing the moth’s chin with the growing need of her cunt.");
	outputCodex("\n\nBetween hammer-thrusts of dragon cock into her mouth, Lusina’s fingers fell upon her own cunt, diving down between her kneeling legs and eagerly sliding into their owner’s body. She took in a long, deep breath - no mean feat while getting face-fucked - and let her lust take over. One hand delving into her twat, massaging her clit and inner walls with fuzzy fingers, while the other snaked its way up Eryxienne’s thigh, teasing the dragon’s sweet-smelling slit until she was able to slip a pair of fingers inside. Once past the dragon’s lips, Lusina’s fingers all but fell in to the knuckle, burying themselves in the dragon-girl’s thrusting crotch until Eryxienne threw her head back with an exultant cry.");
	outputCodex("\n\nAt least I give as good as I get, Lusina thought to herself, wrapping her tongue around Eryxienne’s crown.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“How about you put those big, beautiful tits of yours to use?”</i> the dragon said with a moan, pulling herself out of Lusina’s mouth until just her tip was brushing the moth’s lip. <i>“They look like they were made for fucking.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nLusina blushed, but obediently cupped her breasts and presented them to the dragoness. Her pink nipples were fully erect, standing as proud little islands in two rounded seas of creamy titflesh, big enough that she couldn’t get her hands all the way around her cleavage. Eryxienne smiled, giving Lusina a gentle push against the cave wall and let her prick drop into the valley between the moth’s ample rack, smearing it with the spittle still clinging to her rose-red pecker. Lusina pressed her tits together around it, leaning back and closing her eyes, content to feel the dragoness’s cock slide between her boobs, teasing the over-sensitive titflesh until she was ready to cum.");
	outputCodex("\n\nEryxienne wasted no time in taking advantage of the soft, jiggling rack wrapped around her draconic dick. With no mouth to worry about hurting, her hips quickly picked up to a fever pitch, pounding away at the undersides of Lusina’s tits, making them bounce and quake with every thrust. The moth found herself smiling between pleasured moans, listening to the dragon-girl’s breath become more and more ragged with every piston of her hips, moans turning into cries, and then into yelps of orgasmic pleasure. <i>“Cumming! I’m cumming!”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nLusina just leaned back and let it happen, squeezing her tits tighter around the hammering dragon-dick until she felt a sudden surge of heat, and then a burst of wetness splattering across her chin and cheeks, then squirting out onto the tops of her tits. She let out a squeaking moan as Eryxienne slammed herself to the hilt between Lusina’s breasts and held there, groaning and squirting and slathering the moth’s tits with dragon spunk until Lusina’s head swam with the rich, alluring scent of it. She hadn’t thought she could get more turned on, but the smell of semen slathering her body just made her want the dragoness’s cock all the more...");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“I hope that wasn’t it,”</i> Lusina moaned, opening her eyes and taking in the sight of her spunk-coated body. Mindlessly, her fingers started to run through the puddles of spunk, smearing it around - a little part of her brain quietly told her that she liked being covered in cum. Especially when it came from a big, beautiful wyrm with a big, beautiful cock between her legs...");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“It? Not by a long shot,”</i> Eryxienne assured her, slipping down to her knees and running her tongue along the swell of her lover’s breast, licking up a swathe of her own spunk. <i>“I’m a dragon, after all. Our stamina is legendary.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nLusina moaned, arching her back and pressing her rack into the dragon-girl’s face. She found her hand reaching down, fluffy fingers wrapping around the half-hard member between her partner’s legs, urging it back to turgidity. <i>“Is that so?”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“I’ll prove it,”</i> the dragon purred between licks, slowly cleaning off Lusina’s breasts... before reaching up for a kiss, pressing their lips together, and depositing a mouthful of hot cum onto Lusina’s tongue. The moth’s eyes went wide, wings and heart fluttering as the taste hit her before going limp in Eryxienne’s arms, surrendering to the dragon’s will. <i>“Good girl...”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nA pair of clawed hands found their way under Lusina’s taut little butt and hefted her up, first to her feet, then back against the wall. She moaned, wrapping her arms around Eryxienne’s neck, and her legs around the dragoness’s hips, guiding their bodies together until Eryxienne’s prick rubbed against the slit of her sex.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“That was quick,”</i> Lusina managed to murmur, sucking in a sharp breath as her lover’s cock gently nudged its way past her lower lips.");
	outputCodex("\n\nEryxienne smiled, said <i>“Legendary stamina, little moth,”</i> and pressed her lips and hips forward at once, stifling Lusina’s moans in a kiss. Lusina’s whole body went rigid at the moment of penetration, every nerve turning wholesale towards the feeling of cockflesh spearing her womanhood, stretching her slick walls out. Eryxienne’s cock glided in easily, helped along by Lusina’s spit and arousal, and the thick glaze of cum still clinging to the shaft.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThe kiss persisted, punctuated by Eryxienne hilting herself in the depths of Lusina’s sex. The moth-girl moaned, fingers digging into the dragoness’s shoulders, trying to steady herself as her body was stretched out around a foot of wet dick - and her lips were battered by its swollen, reptilian base.");
	outputCodex("\n\nEryxienne’s wings curled around her, bathing the two of them in darkness in the same moment her turgid base pushed into Lusina’s cunt, eliciting a scream of pleasure from the bouncing moth. <i>“Fuck!”</i> Lusina cried, throwing her head back and squirming against the dragon’s grasp. <i>“Too much! Too much!”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Shh,”</i> Eryxienne cooed, kissing one of the moth-girl’s nipples. <i>“Just hold on to me, and let yourself go...”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nLike she needed the dragon to tell her that! The feeling of being spread out so wide was nearly enough to make Lusina cum on the spot, and a few short, jerky thrusts from the knotted wyrm sent her screaming over the edge. Lusina felt climax tear through her, welling up in her gut and exploding downwards in a rain of pussyjuice around the dragoness’s hilted dick. Eryxienne moaned, digging her hands into Lusina’s ass and thrusting deeper, fucking right through the heat of her lover’s climax. Her movements only served to stir the moth up even more, churning her pussy like a vat of boiling girl-spunk until it popped in another rain of fem-cum, one orgasm on the back of the first. She screamed until her lungs ached, bucking her hips against the thick pole of dragon-meat tearing her apart, batting her wings against Eryxienne’s until she thought the two of them would take flight.");
	outputCodex("\n\nInstead, they pressed hard against the back of the cavern, panting and gasping and moaning into each other’s lips. Lusina felt a third orgasm well up, hitting her at the same time she felt Eryxienne’s cock discharge inside her, flooding her womb with more of that intoxicating dragon spunk. Caution flew to the wind, and Lusina found herself helping her lover to fuck her deeper, to get that draconic member as deep inside as it could go, all the better to fill her cunt until she was positively packed, and creamy white started to drool out around even the tight fit of Eryxienne’s knot plugging her hole.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Oh goddess,”</i> Lusina whispered, feeling all volition drain out of her limbs. <i>“Oh my goddess...”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Better than your little bounty, isn’t it?”</i> the dragon purred, kissing Lusina again and again, trailing her lips down across her lover’s breasts and caressing her still-hard nipples. <i>“I think you’ve more than paid your tribute, my dear moth.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nEryxienne smiled, still holding Lusina tight as she walked back from the cavern wall with confident strides that quickly had the two of them at the foot of the throne. She sat back upon it, unfurling her wings and letting Lusina rest in her lap - and driving her cock just a little deeper into the moth’s pussy as she did.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“I can’t get up,”</i> Lusina admitted what seemed like an eternity later, still resting her cheek on Eryxienne’s shoulder. The knot of her lover’s cock was still inside her, though Lusina secretly knew it was her own limp legs that betrayed her, keeping her bound to her lover. She couldn’t stand if she wanted it.");
	outputCodex("\n\nEryxienne only smiled, running a hand along her cheek. <i>“I know, love. Just relax and sleep... let your tribute take hold inside you.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Wha...”</i> Lusina managed to breathe, a moment before her eyes fluttered closed.");
	
	outputCodex("\n\nIt wasn’t until the next week that Lusina finally realized what her draconic lover’s <i>“tribute”</i> had really meant. By then she had grown accustomed to the dragon’s lair, to waking each morning in the wyrm’s tender embrace, and falling asleep again to the rough pounding of Eryxienne’s massive cock filling her womb again and again.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThe dragoness had never offered to show Lusina a way out of her lair, never given her permission to leave, but in the same way that Lusina had never asked for it. Something told her that she could have left at any time, but the urge never struck. Whenever her thoughts turned to the forest, to her home far away in the distance, her draconic lover would always remind her why she stayed: with a kiss, a caress, and soon carrying her into the nest she called a bed to make passionate love.");
	outputCodex("\n\nIt was only when Lusina’s belly started to swell that she realized what her tribute meant. It grew and grew over the span of days, until by the end of the second week she looked like a woman ready to deliver. Eryxienne told her between fucking and cuddling that she was carrying a dragon egg inside her, that she’d been gifted with a rare and precious honor.");
	outputCodex("\n\nShe laid it in the third week, screaming in pleasure as Eryxienne and her kobold minions tended to her. The little reptiles had all delivered eggs of their own during Lusina’s stay, filling Eryxienne’s nest with more and more nascent young - though the moth took pride in seeing that her egg was by far the largest and most colorful of the clutch, and as she curled up to sleep with her arms around it, legs spread for the inevitable arrival of her egg’s father ready to put another in her, she felt more like a queen than she’d ever felt in her silly dreams.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThis was a true dragon’s hoard: not riches of gold and gems, but of her lover’s constant affection, and the feeling of a second egg taking inside her as she yet warmed the first...");

	outputCodex("\n\nHyra had known the svelte, almost effete mini-minotaur in front of her for maybe a month. They’d adventured together, braved the corrupted wastes of Mareth, and found a few intimate moments together too. When they’d returned to the Bizarre Bazaar, Hyra had expected what any good gnollish warrior would after a victorious campaign: good drink, rowdy song, and the company of a submissive little fuck-slut of a male to while away the nights.");
	outputCodex("\n\nInstead, she’d seen her party’s minitaur, Kell, flaunting his wares in the parlour of the Bazaar’s high-class bordello. She only saw him for a moment before a rich-looking woman led him off for the night, but that was enough to put an idea in her mind. An idea that had her running around the Bazaar for the better part of an hour, searching out what she needed to make a reality of the fantasies that had been dominating her mind more and more since she first took up with Kell and his company...");
	outputCodex("\n\nIt had started with Urta. That damned she-fox had turned the tables when the proud gnoll princess had jumped her on the plains, and force-fed her a vial of Succubus Milk Hyra had been saving for a special femboy back at camp. Her tits had grown as large as melons in the blink of an eye: long enough for Urta to whip out a massive cock from under her uniform and take advantage of the burgeoning new flesh. Hyra had lost her pride, her fur, and her face to the vixen’s punishment. Now she looked like little more than any other dog-girl in the streets, with a smooth human face and a whorish bust that strained her clothes... and they’d become so sensitive that just feeling her black nipples rubbing against the fabric of her clothing was an eternal agony, always keeping her on the unbearable edge of climax.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThen came the traps. Her first day in Kell’s company, she’d been on the run from her gnollish heritage and desperate for a way to make ends meet without the luxury and service of her people. For once, she was outside of her queenly mother’s watchful eye. Hearing the call for mercenaries, she’d joined up without a second thought. But their first foray out had been riddled with traps from a bygone age that changed their bodies the deeper they went into the dungeon. Now, Hyra could barely recognize herself in the mirror: her tits had grown again, now bovine-like H-cups constantly swelling with an unnatural bounty of sweet milk. The throbbing black clit between her legs, the hallmark of a gnoll alpha female, was gone. In its place, a huge and constantly-hard canid cock with a knot as big around as her fist. There was barely anything left of the shapely gnoll princess that had set out for an afternoon’s hunt. In her place was something that, in Hyra’s eyes, looked more like a vagabond cow come down from the mountains.");
	outputCodex("\n\nShe should have hated it. Should have rebelled against what her body was becoming against her will.");
	outputCodex("\n\nInstead, her erections were becoming more frequent. Uncontrollable. She had a hair trigger, and no amount of self chastisement could sway her from the fact that she was falling in love with the pleasure. And lately, her nightly fantasies were less about squealing little gnoll-boys spreading their cheeks for her new manhood, and more about the mind-shattering pleasure of feeling a minotaur’s hands around her puffy black teats, milking her until she creamed herself again and again around his pistoning bull-cock.");
	outputCodex("\n\nFifty gems and an evening’s wait in the whorish lap of luxury was more than a fair price to make that fantasy come true, she thought. When the brothel mistress had finally called her – politely standing between Hyra and the rich jane being carried out in a stupor by a pair of girls, drooling minotaur cum from all three fuck-holes, the erstwhile gnoll could not hide her excitement. Her breeches bulged obscenely, and her cow-like nipples tented even her leather vest. She could feel prying eyes wandering across her body from all around the foyer, even from the mistress herself.");
	outputCodex("\n\nFuck ’em, let ’em look, she told herself, raising her tail high as the mistress lead her upstairs, to the pleasure room of her newest temporary employee. One night only: the most addictive cock in all of the bazaar, only fifty gems for as many orgasms as you can take. Hell of a deal at twice the price; one that Hyra intended to make full use of.");
	outputCodex("\n\nKell just about jumped out of his fur when he saw Hyra enter, towering and muscular and grinning from ear to canid ear. Her tail wagged a mile a minute as she thanked the mistress, handed off her gems, and locked the door behind her. Not for the first time, she looked at the nude minitaur with eyes aglow with lust. Sure, he’d helped her out with her milking problem at first – who better qualified to tend to a growing cow-girl than a bull boy? – but tonight, behind locked doors, she owned him. His body was hers to command. She could have asked for anything she wanted, and Kell knew it.");
	outputCodex("\n\nHe’d been waiting for this moment, she was sure. The moment the big, strong gnoll bitch decided to bend him over and break him. That’s what minitaurs were for back home: living cock-cozies for the strongest dick-wielders that could wrestle them down. She could only imagine the things his poor little pucker could do to a throbbing doggy-cock like hers. The thought alone made her shiver with delight.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“W-what are you...”</i> the little minitaur started, but Hyra cut him off with a raised finger, pressing it to his lips. She just smiled to him and turned to face the door, leaving her back to the call-bull.");

	outputCodex("\n\nHyra wondered if he was reaching for some of the drugs they’d picked up. The fuck-drafts and dryad’s nectar that could incapacitate with lust. Would he do that just to protect his ass? She bet he would... and that would be just fine. An even more real way to live out her fantasy. But when nothing came, nothing hit her over the head or grabbed at her mouth to force the drugs down, she just wagged her tail and reached into her pack.");
	outputCodex("\n\nYou’d never believe how hard it is to find a special-made hairband. The kind with two little horns on top, and a pair of poofy cow ears on the side. The kind the milk-sluts in Tel’Adre wear to tell themselves they’re really cow-girls and not just easy lays with massive tits. Just like Hyra. She slipped it on, feeling her heart pounding in her chest as the tight band snapped onto either side of her head, pressing down her dog-ears and replacing them with mock bovine counterparts. Her fingers curled around the shoulder strap of her vest and tore it side, letting the huge, heavy orbs of chocolate-skinned breast fall free. Just the shift in weight, the feeling of material rushing across her nipples, was enough to bring her to full hardness beneath her breeches. Those went too, falling limply to the ground and kicked aside in one swift motion.");
	outputCodex("\n\nHyra turned back around, smiling, running her hands along the tops of her breasts and letting her throbbing dog-cock bob heavily in front of her, already cresting with a hint of white cream.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Make you what?”</i> she teased, flicking a finger across each of her night-black teats. Her knees threatened to buckle, shuddering beneath her as pleasure unlike any other washed across her body. <i>“Make you treat me like an animal? Make you fulfill every impotent desire in your little minitaur heart?”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nHyra took a step forward, reaching into her bag and pulling out a heavy metal collar, padded and leashed with a metal chain. Her arms stretched out, offering the pet-owner’s package to her minitaur escort. <i>“You’re a minotaur, right? You know how to treat a cow-girl. It’s in your blood,”</i> she smirked, stepping forward again. The stiffness between her legs was almost painful, threatening to boil over at the slightest touch. Marae’s name, she had such a hair trigger now she was sure just a smile from the bull-boy would have her making a mess of the floor.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“I want you to help me fulfill a fantasy of mine. I want to feel like a cow... and there’s nobody in this damn place who could do that better than you. I want...”</i> Hyra grinned, gently pressing the collar and leash into the bewildered Kell’s hands, <i>“I just want you to bend me over and fuck me like an animal. Milk me like a cow. Make my belly swell with cum and make me empty my balls and tits until I’m dry and still trying to cum again.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nShe took one last step, pressing herself up to Kell. He was just at tit-height for her, small and svelte and beautiful... and hard as a rock. His minotaur’s cock pressed firmly against her belly, and his tiny little muzzle nested between the enormous, fully-laden mounds of her breasts. She reached down and cupped his chin, forcing him to look up at her. He was smiling, the previous look of fear and loathing replaced by unconstrained, bestial lust. Her body was bringing out the animal in him, the minotaur fuck-beast ready to breed.");
	outputCodex("\n\nHyra leaned down, close enough to feel his hot breath on her black lips. She kissed him, a playful peck on the nose before whispering, <i>“Think you can do that for me... my strong, beautiful bull?”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nBefore Hyra had time to blink, she was on her back, slamming into the brothel room’s bed with all the force the mino-boy could muster: and as turned on as he was, Kell might as well have been a full-on ‘taur. He was on her in an instant, huffing and grunting and grabbing at Hyra’s tits. She yelped in surprise and pain as he slammed the collar around her neck, so tight she saw stars for a moment. One of his furred hands locked around a black nipple, pulling hard on it until a spray of milk jetted out between his digits, and Hyra’s back arched until her chest was almost pressing against his.");
	outputCodex("\n\nShe came. Hard. Her cock shot off a geyser of hot, masculine cream against Kell’s thighs, painting the bull with seed and causing the gnoll-cow to convulse in pleasure. She screamed, bucking under him, milk and spunk and feminine fluids drawn out of her body as if by magic. The bed sheets darkened as her sex-juices seeped into them, but neither she nor Kell paid any attention to them at all. Pleasure, dominance, and basest instinct were all that were left.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“K-Kell!”</i> Hyra managed to gasp, but it wasn’t sweet little Kell she was dealing with anymore. The creature on top of her, groping her chest and tugging her leash... this was a totally different animal. A creature of unbridled lust and dominant instinct. A force held inside that cute little body for so long and so well that Hyra had been afraid it wasn’t there at all.");
	outputCodex("\n\nKell answered her cry by grabbing her hips, flipping Hyra over onto her belly and pulling her back until her powerful legs dangled haplessly over the edge. His hooves stamped against the floorboards, like a bull about to charge, and Kell yanked so hard on the leash that Hyra was forced upwards, bending her back and jutting her tail straight up.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThat was all the invitation the beast-bull needed. Hyra screamed again as something massive, hot, and hard slammed against the quivering lips of her womanhood, demanding entry. She was no blushing virgin – far from it – but Hyra’s eyes widened in terror as she felt the bestial endowment’s flared head pushing against her hole. Kell was relentless, strong as an ox and in a position where Hyra could do nothing but submit, moaning and crying and gushing milk onto the bed as her lips finally parted, letting the tremendous girth of Kell’s cock enter her.");
	outputCodex("\n\nAnother orgasm hammered through her, as startling and mind-shredding as the first. All traces of conscious thought were swept aside in a tidal wave of pleasure as Hyra’s half-hard gnoll-cock sprayed a second helping of seed across the floor, and her udders sprayed like geysers from their black tips.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Fuck! Fuckfuckfuckme!”</i> Hyra managed to moan, her lips fighting against her desperate attempts to form words. Her whole body quivered with delight, trembling and quaking with mindless pleasure. Her cock wouldn’t stop cumming, draining her better than a succubus’s lips ever could.");
	outputCodex("\n\nAnd Kell was all of an inch inside her.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“You got it,”</i> Kell grunted, pistoning his hips forward like a machine. Hyra gasped, her screams going silent as her breath completely escaped her. Her lover yanked hard on her leash, pulling her down on his cock even as he thrust into the squeezing vice of Hyra’s cunt. Her belly bulged between her and the sodden sheets, straining to take the massive size of Kell’s animalistic cock.");
	outputCodex("\n\nAn impossible, unspeakably orgasmic moment later she felt his meaty black balls slap against her raised ass, and his hips pound against her tender cheeks. Her own prick throbbed meekly against his leg, finally finishing its wet load and going still. The rest of Hyra’s body convulsed with ecstasy, but she could marshal no will, no iota of strength to move or moan or resist in any way as her cowish body reformed itself around what it was made for: a bull’s huge, throbbing dick.");

She screamed, entire body clenching down around the hyper-sized invader, and her mind went into overdrive, suddenly processing everything that was happening to her... and loving every minute of it.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“What do you say?”</i> Kell repeated, still pinning her down with all his weight and savaging her breasts.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThe answer was so natural, came so suddenly and so easily that Hyra barely realized she said it.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Moo!”</i> she cried, bucking against the bull’s hips, squirting milk from what felt like infinite reserves all across the bed. <i>“Moo! Moo!”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nKell grinned, leaning in against her back until his breath was hot and heavy against her neck. <i>“Good cow,”</i> he growled, nipping at her neck and starting to move his hips. Hyra cried out, a combination of mooing and exultantly crying out in pleasure as the massive rod of bull-meat slid out of her sodden, ruined cunt, leaving her gaping wide enough that Kell could easily have slipped his whole arm inside her if he’d wanted to. Instead, he thrust back in again, from flare to balls in one massive stroke that left him grunting like an animal and grabbing at Hyra’s tits in both hands, milking them as thoroughly as she was milking his cock.");
	outputCodex("\n\nA third thrust, and he came. Hyra gasped, eyes going wide as a flood of warm, sticky wetness flooded into her battered womb... but her tail lifted in response, and her beleaguered cock stiffened eagerly as her body stretched to accept the virile bull’s load. One of Hyra’s hands managed to grasp her belly, feeling it strain and bloat around what felt like a gallon of hot bull-spunk. She couldn’t imagine how much milk she gave out in response, just watched as a flood pool formed beneath the bed, gushing off the sheets and onto the floorboards.");
	outputCodex("\n\nKell pulled back with a feral roar, letting his creampie join Hyra’s milk in sloshing to the floor... this time drooling hotly down the gnoll-cow’s thighs and down the underside of her cock, splattering in hot clumps onto the ground.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Gods,”</i> Hyra gasped, eyes unfocused, body unresponsive. She couldn’t move a muscle if she wanted to, left helpless to her body’s pleasure-tremors. Her cock throbbed and came again, spurred on by the heat drooling wetly down its shaft, adding her meager orgasm to Kell’s gallon.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“What, you don’t think you’re done yet, do you?”</i> Kell laughed, and Hyra could hear a cork popping behind her. The smell of dryad’s sap hit her nose, sweet and fruity and potent enough that she stiffened again even on the heels of an orgasm, cock and teats diamond hard by the time she heard Kell gulp, and felt his flare prod against her thus-far unruined hole. She gasped, trembling in pleasure as his cockhead pressed against her ass. <i>“Cows aren’t done until they’re ten loads deep. I’m not stopping until your belly’s so full they’ll have to roll you out of here.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\nAll Hyra could do was moo as her bull’s irresistible manhood thrust in, driven on again and again and again by magic fuck-drugs and feral lust.");

Next, the scrawled-on parchment had to be put in a big jug of strong liquor and soaked for two weeks. Bosh did it, though buying so much liquor used up the rest of his month’s wages. Finally, the spell required enzyme scraped from the tail of a male sydian to be added when the soaking finished. Bosh was beaten pretty badly getting the enzyme, but luckily he had the two weeks to recover. On the appointed night, he was loading a medicine dropper with enzyme when he heard a knock at his door.");

Next he fished out the parchment, tore it into seven pieces, and dropped them back into the jug, just as instructed. Finally, to finish the spell, he chugged the entire jug.

She tossed the tank into the storage bay with the rest of their haul: three uncharted worlds’ worth of undiscovered species.  Even splattered with screechworm slime and panting from exertion, Evie couldn’t wait for uncharted world number four.  Nothing in the galaxy could beat the thrill of the hunt.");

	outputCodex("\n\nEvie stuffed her bare feet into the legs of the spacesuit and tugged it up around her waist.  The material shrank around her body as she pulled it on, forming a skin-tight seal around her figure.  Outside, the thickening atmosphere burned a crisp orange rim around the sun. As Evie wiggled the seam along her back closed, the shifting sunlight shined off her suit, cupping the perky curve of her ass.");
	outputCodex("\n\nHer chest arched forward as she reached over her shoulders to fasten the suit’s collar.  The top half of the silvery suit smoothed and tightened and clung to her bust. The natural tautness of her spacesuit pushed her breasts together and and lifted them up, removing any need for a bra.  The pinkish glare of the planet’s sun wrapped across the front of her tightly-encased bosom. Outside the window, mountains and forests loomed larger as the ship dropped through the atmosphere.");

	outputCodex("\n\nEvie walked along the banks of the pond until she found a sunny patch of shoreline to rest. She stopped, clipped her blaster pistol into its holster, and leaned against a fern-tree. Using both hands, she grabbed her helmet and twisted. The vacuum seal made a thick schlock as it disengaged.  Lifting the bubble helmet off her head, she was greeted by the warm air, the weight of humidity against her fur, and the natural but alien smells of thick Xenobian vegetation.");
	outputCodex("\n\nMina would have insisted Evie keep her helmet on, but Mina didn’t appreciate how sharp Evie’s senses of smell and hearing were.  Her pointed ears could pick up the rustle of a rare species in the brush and her vulpine nose could sniff out the presence of profit to be made. Maybe Mina’s human senses were so dull it didn’t matter, but Evie hunted more effectively without the helmet.");
	outputCodex("\n\nEvie took a seat on the sand and stretched her legs out in front of her.  Her blonde hair spilled back behind her, freed from her helmet. This wasn’t her taking a break, though. What she was doing was waiting for the alien fauna to acclimatize to her presence.  The warm sun against her fur and warm sand underneath her was just a bonus.");
	outputCodex("\n\nAfter about ten minutes, she heard something.  Her ears perked up, though her eyes stayed shut She didn’t move just yet.  Leaves rustled as something moved through the brush.  Her hand drifted down to rest on her blaster pistol, slowly dialing the energy down from Maim to Stun.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThe sound came closer.  Evie pulled her legs in, ready to stand, to move, to run if necessary.  It was to her right.  She pushed herself up onto her feet, making as little noise as possible.  Turning to the right, she watched the brush.");
	outputCodex("\n\nSomething narrow, long, and pink pushed through the leaves.  Its head was rounded and spade-shaped, like a snake’s. It had small black eyes and a flickering black tongue. A pair of stalk-like antennae poked up from the back of its head. Its body was smooth and round, about an inch-and-a-half in diameter, and two feet long.  Its slick surface glistened like rubber, and glowed in the light as if it was translucent.  A series of ridges wrapped around its girth, giving it a ribbed appearance.");
	outputCodex("\n\nEvie had only seen it for a few seconds, but was already trying to name it. Xenobian dildo-snake? The Coalition scientists might get upset about that, but it wasn’t her fault that it looked so phallic.  Her blaster pistol let out a whine as she laid her finger on the trigger.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Hey there, little guy,”</i> Evie said.  The dildo-snake curled over the trunk of the fern-tree and flicked its tongue into the air. She closed one eye and lifted her pistol. <i>“Just gonna put you to sleep.”</i>");

The blast clipped a chunk of the fern-tree’s trunk, but missed the snake by inches. The mist clung to her fur and burrowed into her nose and crawled along her tongue.  The sweet taste filled her mouth no matter how much she shook her head and spat at the ground.  Her snout wrinkled and she sneezed.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Little bastard,”</i> Evie growled. She rubbed her silvery sleeve against her eyes and sniffled.  Despite her sneeze, the sweet smell had lodged in her nose. It had to be some sort of psychoactive enzyme, a defense mechanism.  Her eyelids fluttered and her eyes struggled to focus on the snake.  Her blaster was like a lead weight in her hands: dragging her arms down, making it impossible to aim.");

The radio slipped from her hand and fell down among the fern-tree roots.");

Her expert vulpine tracking senses told her that the mist was really, really nice. She lapped the residue off her lips.  Sniffling, she scrunched up her snout, then sneezed out a puff of pink.  She let out a sleepy snicker. ");

	outputCodex("\n\nThe snake slid off of her arm and started a slow arc along her inner thigh. Moving her arms was a challenge, but Evie managed to tug off her gloves and toss them aside.  Her bare pawpads stroked against the snake’s back, like she was petting a cat.  Its skin felt as slick as it looked, but it wasn’t slimy; it was more like smooth rubber.  She gave it an experimental squeeze; its flesh was squishy and pliable, but firm.");
	outputCodex("\n\nEvie was so wrapped up in petting her new friend that she didn’t realize what it was doing until its head bumped up against her crotch.  She tugged its tail to pull it back, but it just slithered up between her legs again. Her head cocked to one side as she looked down. <i>“Cut it out, you’re not a dog,”</i> she said. Evie couldn’t get a good grip on its body; her fingers were too slow and it was too rubbery-slick.  It slipped out of her fingers and nuzzled up against her crotch again.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThe snake opened its mouth.  Where a Terran snake had fangs, it had a series of ridges along either side of its mouth, like the blades of a razor.  One snap of its jaws tore Evie’s skintight silver spacesuit open. Her pussy, surrounded by pale underbelly fur, was suddenly exposed.  The bare air against her privates and the brush of the snake’s razor-teeth roused some sense out of Evie’s pleasant daze.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Woah, buddy, take it easy,”</i> Evie said, trying to squirm away.  Her heels scuffled against the ground.  Her back pushed up against the fern-tree trunk.  Even the adrenaline pumping through her couldn’t shake the pink haze from her thoughts or help her to think straight. She tried to block her pussy with her hand but the snake slipped right between her fingers. Its head wiggled against her folds and began to squirm its way in.");
	outputCodex("\n\nEvie recoiled, thumping her shoulders back against the tree. <i>“You are not supposed to ghhk–!”</i> A sudden jerk from the snake squeezed the words out of Evie’s mouth. It wormed its way deeper into her, curling and twisting its body as it went.  Evie’s fingers clamped down around the snake’s tail and pulled as hard as she could.  It became a tug-of-war between her and the snake; she would drag it out only for it to slip free and writhe its way back into her. Back and forth, in and out, until it became a steady rhythm. Her hips jerked, bumping against her fists as she started bucking back against the snake’s squirming. Her eyelids fluttered, and a heavy moan left her lips.");
	outputCodex("\n\nWhere the snake’s body touched her folds, it rubbed a slick substance off on her, like natural lubrication.  Her skin absorbed it readily.  The more the snake writhed, the more that goo coated her pussy, and the hotter the aching heat between her legs grew.  Her free hand clutched the ground beneath her.  She struggled to take gasping breaths as the snake slithered deeper into her swollen, tender pussy.");
	outputCodex("\n\nEvie’s drugged body couldn’t stay up.  She leaned to one side, then spilled onto the ground.  Laying on her back, legs parted, the forest canopy spun around her.  Her knees were bent and her feet planted on the ground.  She had enough leverage to jerk her hips into the air each time the snake squirmed inside of her.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThrough the haze of sex, Evie knew she had to get this thing out of her. With both hands, she grabbed the snake’s tail and pulled.  Its ridges popped out of her pussy one by one, until only its head was still left inside.  But as soon as she lost her grip, the snake snapped back into her, burying its glistening pink body in her pussy.  Ears flattened against her head, eyes rolling back, the vixen let out a cry of both shock and pleasure.");
	outputCodex("\n\nHer hands grasped the roots of the fern-tree, sinking her claws into their fleshy exterior.  As her hips bucked, sixteen inches of snake flopped through the air.  Her pussy felt so swollen and so tight that if Evie hadn’t known better, she would think she was in heat.  A rabid, mindless need had overtaken her body.  The most she could do was reach down, grasp her swollen mound, and rub at her folds with her pawpads while the snake wriggled between her fingers.");
	outputCodex("\n\nHer blonde hair had spilled onto the ground, providing a pillow for her cheek while she panted. Her lips and throat were dry. Each squirm from the snake made her body jerk and clench.  Its length filled her to the brim and couldn’t get any deeper.  At least that was some small consolation: it couldn’t get worse.");
	outputCodex("\n\nAnd then the snake opened its mouth.  The tight feeling made Evie grunt. She didn’t know what happened next, but a sudden burst of numbing pleasure shot through her lower body, drowning out all other sensations. An animal yip left her throat and her body curled up into the air. The snake began to move again.  It slithered deeper into her, twisting and pushing against parts of her that had never felt that sort of pressure before.");
	outputCodex("\n\nHer silvery space suit bulged around her belly.  Evie’s hind claws curled against the inside of her boots.  She bit her lip, huffing through her nose.  She tried to push against the swell in her lower abdomen, but a tender pang made her hand recoil.  There wasn’t much time left.  Before what, Evie didn’t know, but if she wanted this out of her, she had to act now.");
	outputCodex("\n\nAbout eight inches of tail still poked out from between her puffy folds.  She bent over, ignoring the throbbing in her stomach, and grasped the snake’s tail.  Rolling back, she pulled as hard as she could.  The snake went taut, all the way up her pussy and into her womb.  It began to slide.  She adjusted her grip and kept pulling. ");
	outputCodex("\n\nThen there was a rubbery thwap.  The dildo-snake snapped out of her hands and writhed violently.  It wriggled its way back into her, until its pink tail vanished between her folds. Evie’s eyes rolled back into her head and she cried out loud. Her hips jerked into the air. Fluids dripped onto the forest floor, both her own clear juices and the snake’s viscous pink secretions.");
	outputCodex("\n\nEvie flopped onto the ground, eyelids half-closed, chest heaving. The sudden burst of pleasure left her mind empty, all her thoughts quieted while her brain tried to process the orgasm she’d just had.

	outputCodex("\n\nHer ears perked up and her eyes widened. But just as that realization dawned on her, a blissful tingling feeling washed over her scalp and made her fur stand on end. A small tickle met her nose and she sneezed. She shook her head. Her sudden panic rolled around for a moment, and then fizzled out. She didn’t even feel the gentle nudges moving her thoughts around. Evie couldn’t help laughing.  Why had she been so freaked out?  That snake had been a cute friend who’d given her a good time.  Nothing wrong with that.");
	outputCodex("\n\nHer hand moved to her crotch without thinking.  She was still swollen from her strange sexual experience. She parted her folds with a gentle touch and began to rub herself.  The feeling that something wasn’t right crept up over her again, and again her hair bristled. She sniffled. She was always horny, wasn’t she?  It wasn’t strange that she was fingering herself.  Just enjoy it.");
	outputCodex("\n\nEvie staggered up to her feet.  Aside from the leaves and twigs in her hair and the hole in her suit over her crotch, she looked like the same fox-morph that had left the ship.  She leaned a shoulder against the fern-tree trunk for support.  Her free hand curled up around one of her breasts, pressing her fingers against her nipple until it stiffened against the fabric of her suit.  She rolled the tip between her fingers while her other hand pumped away at her dripping wet pussy.");
	outputCodex("\n\nEvie paused. She pulled her hand free.  Thick pink liquid ran in small beads along her fingers.  That had to be strange, right?  Evie shivered and let out an involuntary titter as her nose tickled.  No, that was normal.  She was just really horny, remember?  She licked her lips and grinned.  Made sense, a pretty vixen like herself having a sex drive to match.  Enough sense that she didn’t think to question it.");
	outputCodex("\n\nEvie pushed herself off of the fern-tree trunk and began to retrace her steps back to the pond.  Her fingers were tucked tight between her legs, rubbing constantly.  The pink fluid ran down her hand and dripped onto the forest floor, leaving a trail behind her.");

Evie sat down on the sand, stretched out, and fingered herself to a lazy, sticky orgasm.  She plunked her fingers into the water to wash them off.");
	outputCodex("\n\nAgain, Evie’s stomach growled. She lifted her head and scanned the area. Something around here had to be edible. What did her little snake buddy eat? Another rush of tingling and a light sneeze washed away any apprehension about her new parasitic best friend.  Evie giggled sleepily.  After a few deep sniffs, she picked up a sweet, fruity smell coming from the fern-trees by the shore.  Thick vines hung from the fronds, draping down into the water.  She got up and waded into the pond, fetching one of the vines and dragging it back to the shore.");
	outputCodex("\n\nSitting back down on the sand, she stared down at the vine.  How exactly was she supposed to eat this?  Then her stomach quivered and, without thinking, she bent down and bit into the vine.  It crunched, like the surface of a watermelon, thick and waxy until her teeth broke through the rind.  Around her teeth oozed up a thick, yellowish nectar. Her mouth was already watering.  Her stomach groaned. She’d never felt such an intense craving for sugar before. Evie sat back on the sand, holding the vine to her mouth and sucking up the sweet fluid as it dripped out.");
	outputCodex("\n\nSomething wiggled beneath her scalp.  She reached up and scratched at her hair. After the wild time she’d had, it was a blonde mess, a thick, tousled mane with leaves stuck in it.  Her claws rubbed over a pair of small nubs on her scalp. Out of nowhere, she sneezed. Her pussy clenched and dripped a few pink drops, and her eyelids fluttered. Her train of thought shifted to the tight ache between her legs. Her hand dropped back down to keep fingering herself, and she forgot about those little bumps.");
	outputCodex("\n\nEvie’s thoughts felt slow to form and move, like she was pushing around heavy weights in her head.  It wasn’t that she couldn’t think, it was just much easier to let other parts of her body do the thinking for her.  Like her stomach, which was demanding sugar, or her pussy, which was in desperate need of something inside it. It was much easier to satisfy those needs than to try to think about what was going on with her body.");
	outputCodex("\n\nAfter a minute more of sucking down nectar and fingering herself, those little bumps burst up into a pair of smooth, pinkish antennae. Evie felt them growing in and leaned over the water to get a good look. She could wiggle each on their own, and they were rubbery-slick to the touch. They were like the antennae that her snake buddy had sported, but taller and thicker, obviously. She wasn’t sure where her parasitic friend was now, but she had a feeling deep in her lower abdomen that he hadn’t left her.");

What was she thinking about?  Tasty nectar?  She wrapped her lips around the vine and lapped up more of that sweet stuff, while her fingers pumped away between her legs.");
	outputCodex("\n\nWith her lips forming a tight seal, she could suck the nectar from the vine faster than it oozed out on its own. Thick globs of sweet goo rolled down her throat with every gulp and slid down into her hungry belly.  The skintight material of her suit began to stretch.  Not around her stomach–around her chest.  Her nipples popped up stiff and swollen, forming firm bumps on the surface.  The spandex stretched across the thickening midline of her bust. ");
	outputCodex("\n\nThe snug, supportive spacesuit held her breasts as tight as possible, but even it couldn’t keep them from sagging slightly.  She had always been a respectable D-cup, about as big as she could get away with while keeping them from getting in the way.  But as she slurped up that nectar, something deep inside her was converting that sugary energy into mass and packing it into her chest.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThe slow swelling pulled the skin of her breasts taut.  With the vine gripped between her teeth, she spared a hand to squeeze her chest and knead the extra mass filling it up.  Her fingers sunk into her soft flesh.  A pressure from inside pushed outward against her hands. Her nipples were swollen, sticking out from the tips of her heavy tits.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThey weren’t the only part of her that was getting tighter.  Beneath her belt, her hips packed on soft fat.  She already had the genes to cut a stunning figure, but the same force urging her to keep eating was also spurring her body’s growth toward thicker, more pornographic dimensions.  The suit stretched around her more shapely legs, while her thighs gently squeezed her hand.  The hole above her pussy gaped open wider as her broader hips pulled the suit tighter.");
	outputCodex("\n\nMaybe it was weird that she was growing so much, but as soon as she had that thought, her antennae quivered and she groaned through her nose and leaned back.  Her plump pussy throbbed, demanding.  Her thumb brushed carefully against the top of her clit and that thought about her growth fizzled away into nothing.");
	outputCodex("\n\nSomething long and thick and tender squeezed its way down her pussy.  Her arm pressed against the side of her breasts, jostling the heavy mounds each time she rocked her hand.  With every throb of her pussy, the mass inside of her pushed out a little further.  Her knees parted and her legs spread open.");
	outputCodex("\n\nAnother throb, another push, and the bulge inside of her slid closer to her fingers.  She bit her lip and tried to squeeze her muscles to draw it out.  Her hips lifted up into the air. She gripped one of her tits tight, rubbing her swollen nipple in small circles.");
	outputCodex("\n\nAnother throb, a rush of pinkish fluid, and into her hand flopped a shaft.  It was a cock, glossy and pinkish like her snake friend’s skin, but definitely her own.  The sudden touch of her hand against the flesh of her new cock made her groan out loud and thrust into her palm. Only three inches of cock poked from her pussy at first, but it was tender to the touch in a way she’d never felt before.  She started stroking right away.");
	outputCodex("\n\nWith each pump of her hand, she coaxed more of her shaft from her body.  It slid out of her pussy like it was emerging from a sheath.  Behind its tip, it was ridged, just like the snake’s body. It was the same color, the same latexy texture and feeling.  As her hand tightened around her new cock, it stiffened.  A grunt slipped from her nose.  From underneath her shaft slid a pair of testacles, tight-packed and the same glossy pink as the rest of it.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Oh, fuck,”</i> Evie groaned.  Her hand stroked up and down the slick cock, savoring all six inches of shaft.  The head throbbed, and she felt that throb all the way back into her pussy and up into her body.  Unfamiliar urges welled up inside of her.  She wanted to sink her cock deep into something warm; she wanted it squeezed tight; she wanted to cum and spread her snakey friend to as many hosts as...");

Her hands clamped around the base as if trying to keep it down, but her hips jerked uncontrollably.  Her eyes rolled back.  Each buck of her hips made her breasts bounced back against her chest.  With both hands, she pumped up and down over her cock, panting for breath.");
	outputCodex("\n\nA yelp split the air and her eyes went wide.  Her cock bulged for a moment, tight against her grip.  It felt as if she was going to burst.  And then she exploded. Thick, pinkish cum erupted into the air and splashed into the pond, each blast hitting the water with a heavy ploonk.  The sheer intensity of this brand new orgasm dug into her head, dragged her thoughts down to her crotch, and shot them into the air as thick ropes of cum. It lasted maybe fifteen seconds, but it felt like minutes of mind-numbing bliss.");
	outputCodex("\n\nEvie slumped back against the sand.  The last spurts of alien seed trickled down her still-stiff cock while she stared up at the sky, taking slow, panting breaths.  Her head felt so clear and sharp now, like everything that had been clogging up her thoughts had gotten flushed away with her orgasm.  She could focus on the stuff that was really important now: fucking, and finding more hosts.");
	outputCodex("\n\nShuffling up to a sitting position, Evie looked down at her cock with a dazed grin.

	outputCodex("\n\nWhat happened next was almost instinctual.  Her antennas schlicked down into her head, disappearing into her scalp.  Her cock began to roll back up into her, retreating between her folds.  She winced and grunted as her balls popped back inside of her.  The tip of her cock wobbled as the shaft retracted into her body, and then with a pop, it was gone too, leaving behind an unassuming Terran vixen’s pussy.  Aside from being puffy and swollen, her mound looked entirely normal.  The only indication that something was amiss was the slight bulge in her belly and the vacant look in Evie’s eyes.");

Mina paused and glanced back.  Evie had no time to cover it up.  They both looked down at Evie’s bare crotch, then met eyes.");

Evie walked with her pink cock and balls swinging between her thighs.  A pleasant shudder popped her antennae back out of her forehead.");
	outputCodex("\n\nEvie gripped the base of her cock.  Her eyes followed Mina’s ass.  It wasn’t as impressive or curvaceous as her own, but the way the forest light glinted off of the curves drew her hungry gaze. Every squirming, alien instinct in her body was telling her to fuck.");
	outputCodex("\n\nShe picked up the pace and closed the distance between her and Mina.  The human was too focused on retracing her steps to the ship to hear the crunch of leaves behind her.  Evie had to move quick, so in one fast motion, she grabbed the crotch of Mina’s suit and dug in her claws.  A hole ripped open, baring Mina’s crotch to the word.

	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Dildo-snake,”</i> Evie said. <i>“It’s totally different.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Okay, some kind of dildo-snake parasite, and it was ‘so cute’ you let it crawl inside you and grow...that,”</i> Mina said, gesturing toward Evie’s cock. ");
	outputCodex("\n\nEvie nodded.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“I’m not sure whether I believe that or the flower story more,”</i> Mina said.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“It’s true!”</i> Evie whined.  She strained as far forward as the cuffs would allow.  <i>“It’s a really friendly parasite thing and it makes you feel really good.  And I wanted to share it with you because you’re my friend.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Right,”</i> Mina said.  <i>“Well, best case scenario, I’ll find some way to fix you.  Worst case, I sell you with the rest of our haul.”</i>");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“That’s not funny, Mina,”</i> Evie said.  Mina reached out and hit the button to close the shutters.  <i>“Um, like, you are joking, right?  Mina?”</i>  The shutters closed, muffling Evie’s worried voice.");
	outputCodex("\n\nObviously, Mina wasn’t going to sell her partner, but she was still rightfully upset about getting jumped on the way back to the ship. And why had this all happened? Because Evie was too much of a cowboy to keep her stupid helmet on. She’d let Evie sweat it out while she figured out how to get rid of that parasite.");
	outputCodex("\n\nMina grabbed the rails and hauled herself up the ladder from the cargo bay into the main corridor. As she walked toward the crew quarters, a sudden pang hit her stomach.  She doubled over, grasping the railing above her and clutching her belly. Something churned deep inside her, making her stomach gurgle.  Cold sweat broke across her skin. She was... just hungry, right?");
	outputCodex("\n\nInstead of turning right into the crew quarters, she turned left and slid into the kitchen.  Pulling out a meal from the stack of rations, she sat on the counter and began to eat. Even the freeze-dried chicken and reconstituted mashed potatoes tasted good, but the packet of raisins really got her mouth watering. Eating them awakened an intense, sudden craving for something sweet.");
	outputCodex("\n\nShe pulled out a container of strawberry drink mix and whipped herself up a big glass.  She drank it down in a few gulps and licked the red line off her upper lip. It was a relief for sure, but one packet wasn’t going to curb her craving. She filled up another serving, then another, and another, until the sting of strawberry flavoring clung to her mouth and even her spit tasted sugary.");
	outputCodex("\n\nFeeling a little bloated after binging on drinks, Mina squeezed back into the corridor and slid into the tiny medical bay–not much more than a person-sized pod with medical scanners built in. Mina pulled down the terminal screen, watching glowing orange gibberish tick across it for a moment, before stowing it again. It was still churning through the data from her scan of Evie. She left it alone and shuffled back into the crew quarters.");
	outputCodex("\n\nMina stripped off her tank top and pants. Her stomach gurgled as she stepped into the shower stall.  She winced and bent over slightly, until the churning feeling had passed and she could straighten up again. Maybe she was just feeling sick to her stomach.  Maybe you weren’t supposed to drink six glasses of strawberry drink in a row.");
	outputCodex("\n\nShe brushed back her short hair and twisted the dial to Manual (Hot). She wanted a chance to relax.  Manual showers were a waste of time and water, but after today, she’d earned it.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThe warm water poured across her skin.  She collected it in her hands and splashed it over her face, then waved her hands under the soap dispenser and rubbed the lather into her skin.  After nothing but auto-showers for weeks, even just washing by hand felt like a spa day.");
	outputCodex("\n\nShe started from the top and worked her way down: hair first, then head, then body.  So by the time that two little pink nubs had poked out from under her bangs, she was already rinsing off her chest, and didn’t notice the pair of stalks rising out of her forehead.");
	outputCodex("\n\nHer attention was drawn down to her pussy.  Evie’s surprise encounter on the way back to the ship had left it was still swollen and tender.  Mina assumed that it was some substance secreted by Evie’s alien cock that was causing the swelling, but she didn’t know of any way to make it go down.  She tried to angle the water spray such that it would wash her labia clean, but that didn’t help, and brushing her pussy with a soaped-up finger just made her shudder and get more excited.");
	outputCodex("\n\nRed-cheeked and breathing deeply, Mina leaned back against the side of the shower.  The stall was steamy and the water warm enough to keep her from getting cold.  She bit one corner of her lip as she rinsed off her hand, then reached down to start rubbing at her tender pussy.");
	outputCodex("\n\nHer knees buckled. Her hips slid up and down against the wall of the shower stall.  She was so sensitive to each little motion, but she couldn’t help rocking against her fingers.  Her stomach twisted again, but this time, there was a pleasant snugness to the pressure inside.");
	outputCodex("\n\nMina rolled her hips in strange ways, trying to follow the swell and push of the thing deep inside her.  There was something deep inside her?  Tingling crawled up her spine and into her head and before she knew it, she sneezed. She blinked and shook her head and sniffled.  What had she been thinking about? Must not have been important. What was important was that she kept fingering herself and twisting her hips back and forth to coax that thing out of her.");
	outputCodex("\n\nHer muscles clenched in series, as if preparing for something big. She spread her legs and bent over, hand propped against the opposite wall. Hot water ran down her chin and nose and over her shoulders, dripping onto to the floor below. Her lower abdomen bulged as that large, thick thing slid deeper. She grunted and her body  tensed. A burst of numbing pleasure shot through her.");
	outputCodex("\n\nSomething was wrong.  Mina’s cheek twitched and she wrinkled her nose.  Her hand gripped the wall and she closed her eyes.  Another sneeze welled up inside of her and she couldn’t hold it in.  A pink mist hung in the air in front of her until it vanished into the steam, along with her worries.");
	outputCodex("\n\nMina shuddered.  If her knees hadn’t locked, she would have fallen to the floor.  Her pussy was throbbing, almost pulsing along its length. The muscles contracted in waves, dragging that thick mass down further.  Her mouth hung open as she took hot, quick breaths.  Her fingers pumped eagerly against the mounting tension until she came, dripping more than she ever had in her life. Her pink juices ran between her fingers and down her thighs as the water washed them away.");
	outputCodex("\n\nNow, in the afterglow, it was coming.  Pushing her open and spreading her swollen mound until finally, the glossy pink cockhead parted her folds.  She reared back and let out a loud sneeze, one that made sparks trail across the corners of her eyes and left her head spinning.  In a horny fog, the one thing that made the most sense was to grip the head of her cock and start to stroke. ");
	outputCodex("\n\nWith each pull, she coaxed the shaft further out of her body.  It slid forward, stretching her mound around its girth.  Soon three inches, then five, enough to slip her hand around fully and pump up and down.  Her hips rocked. She basked in the intensely physical feeling of thrusting her cock into her hand, so focused and so strong. Once she’d had a taste of it, she needed more.");
	outputCodex("\n\nHer pink balls popped free, hanging down like a counterweight to the seven inches of shaft now sticking from her crotch.  Her eyes rolled, her eyelids fluttered. With a deep moan, she sprayed the wall with her pink cum. Panting in the aftermath, letting go of her cock, she punched the Rinse & Dry button to finish off the shower.  The splash of water rushed down around her cock, and the blasts of air made it wobble and bounce and start to stiffen again.  She was dizzy and her head was spinning and she couldn’t help but smiling. Cumming was such a relief.\n\n");

	outputCodex("Mina staggered nude out of the shower. Her new cock hung in front of her, half-erect.  She rubbed her hand across her cheek, blinking as her mind began to process what had happened, the fact that she now had a cock like a smaller version of Evie’s.  Wait...no, if she had a cock now, that meant that Evie had infect–");
	outputCodex("\n\nAnd then she sneezed.  Not once, but twice, staggering backwards until she bumped up against the bunks.  Her pupils wide and her eyelids drooping, she tried to remember what she was thinking.  Evie’s cock, she remembered that much.  And how big it was.  Mina chewed the corner of her lip, looking down at her own shaft.  A prickling sense that something was off gnawed at the back of her head, but all that met her conscious mind was a sense of jealousy.  How come Evie got to be so big?");
	outputCodex("\n\nMina pulled her tank top over her head and antennae, but left her pants sitting on her bunk.  Something way deep down in her brain told her that if she wanted to get bigger, she needed sugar.  With her cock hanging free, she slipped back into the kitchen, where the container of strawberry mix was still sitting on the counter.");
	outputCodex("\n\nWith a few cups of water, she turned the rest of the powder in the container into a lumpy reddish goo of drink mix concentrate.  Her better sensibilities told her not to go for it, but there was an overriding urge deep in her belly that told her to ignore her sense of taste and gulp it down. She stuck a spoon into the goo, scooped out a big lump of it, and dropped it onto her tongue.");
	outputCodex("\n\nAn explosion of strawberry taste hit her mouth, so intense it was unpleasant, almost metallic.  The sugary sweetness hurt her teeth, so she tried not to let it linger. Instead she spooned globs of red goo onto the back of her tongue and swallowed as quickly as possible.  Even then, the residue turned her saliva red and oppressively sweet. Once she finished off the container, it took three glasses of water before she could taste anything but strawberry flavoring again.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Urgh, like...what am I doing?”</i> Mina groaned, rubbing a hand over her face. Her mind broke through the horny haze clouding her thoughts.  Her nose wrinkled, but she fought the urge to sneeze again.  Staggering back against the counter, she reached out, feeling her cock with one hand and her antennae with the other.  She was infected.  She had to get to the cockpit and...  Mina stifled a giggle.  ‘Cockpit.’");
	outputCodex("\n\nA small surge rippled out through her.  Her cock swelled out into her hand, pressing against the grasp of her fingers.  It slid forward, extending another inch from her crotch.  Beneath her tank top, her nipples perked up, stiff and swollen. Her breasts pressed outward against the fabric.  The skin around her crotch was changing color, shifting from her pale complexion to a more purplish color.");
	outputCodex("\n\nMina had never been more than an A-cup when she even bothered to wear a bra, and now she had a pair of C-cups sitting proudly on top of her chest.  Her firm, taut figure was softened by the swelling curve of her hips. She needed to be physically attractive if she wanted to attract more potential hosts to infect, she thought.");
	outputCodex("\n\nShe closed her eyes and shook her head.  That wasn’t what she wanted at all.  Then she sneezed and her body throbbed in unison, flooding her with tight, squeezing sensations from all quarters.  Her right hand gripped her cock and rubbed along its length, all nine inches of swollen, pink flesh.  Her other hand rose up to her D-cups, grabbing a handful through her tank top and kneading blindly.  <i>“Ohh!”</i> she gasped, her voice lighter and breathier than it should have been. Her eyelids fluttered and she rose up onto her tiptoes, leaning back against the counter.");
	outputCodex("\n\nFocus.  Cockpit.  Distress beacon.");
	outputCodex("\n\nMina stumbled out into the hall, unable to tear her hands away from her chest and her cock.  Drops of pink seed beaded off the tip of her shaft and dripped onto the floor. Her breasts stretched the front of her tank top and made it ride up higher, revealing more of her stomach.  The sway of her hips made her bump into one wall, then the other.");
	outputCodex("\n\nShe slumped against the cockpit door and moaned out loud. Another surge of growth caught her. Her fingers sunk into the swelling flesh of her tits. The tip of her cock wobbled out even further from her body.  A flushed feeling struck her lips; they plumped up, thicker, more pouty and inviting.  She tore her hand away from her cock for long enough to crank open the cockpit door.");
	outputCodex("\n\nMina fell into her pilot’s chair, legs spread open.  From her stomach to her knees, her skin had turned light Xenobian purple. Her cock was large enough to press against the underside of her instrument panel. As she leaned forward, her rounder, heavier tits smashed against some of the buttons and switches.  She flipped on the distress beacon, hit the button to record, and reared back in a loud, chair-shaking sneeze.");
	outputCodex("\n\nEach time she sneezed, it felt like there was less space inside her head, like all her thoughts were being squeezed down and she couldn’t think about the really hard stuff because her tits and her cock and how much she wanted to cum took up all the space there was.");

This is Mina, I’m the pilot, and, uh, we’ve got this... thingy, that... ohhh my god.”</i>  Her eyes rolled back as her cock surged again.  A whole foot long now, and every inch just as sensitive.  A spurt of pink cum squirted from the tip, drooling down onto the floor in front of her.  Her tank top struggled to contain the heavy F-cup tits she’d grown.  Her nipples sent sharp jolts down her spine with every shift of the fabric.");
	outputCodex("\n\n<i>“Um, like, like a snake thing.  And it’s really nngh–”</i> She shuddered, squeezing her thickening thighs together. Another spasm rippled through her cock, another burst of her seed.  Her ass filled up the seat of her pilot’s chair, making a soft cushion for her to sit on.");
	outputCodex("\n\nHer antennae bobbed as her eyes fluttered and she fought to focus.  <i>“It’s really, really nice but you should oh my GOD come and visit us!”</i> she said.  Her head rolled back and she thrust out her chest. A few drops of pink goo splattered onto the flight controls.  A pair of damp spots dripped down the front of her tank top.");
	outputCodex("\n\nWhile Mina kneaded her lactating G-cup tits, her other hand kept pumping away at her cock.  Her eyelids fluttered shut, and when she opened them again, her eyes had turned solid black like Evie’s. Mina moaned and gasped in her sweet, sensual voice until, with a loud cry, she orgasmed.  Her second orgasm was far bigger than her first, splattering the underside of the equipment panel with pink seed. All the serious thoughts in her head popped loose, swept away into the torrent of cum, gushing out onto the cockpit floor.  A vacant giggle slipped from her lips as she slumped against the seat.  Her hand kept rubbing her cock slowly, coaxing out the last few spurts until she was spent and her head was pleasantly empty.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThe red light clicked off and the recorder beeped.  All of her gasping and groaning had made it onto the distress beacon.  With lidded eyes, Mina giggled to herself and licked her plump lips.  Hopefully, all that noise made her invitation more inviting.  She was hungry for new hosts.  It was kind of all she could think about now.\n\n");

Drops of pink fluid steadily dripped from her dark purple nipples. Her cock bobbed between her legs as she hurried to the storage bay where she’d left Evie.");

The fox-morph huffed and breathed in sharply. Her cock rose and stiffened.  A bit of squeezing with Mina’s strokes, and soon Evie’s shaft was firm, tip bobbing in front of Mina’s mouth.");
	outputCodex("\n\nLooking up at Evie, Mina spread her plump, magenta-tinted lips and wrapped them around her glossy shaft.  Evie’s antennae curled eagerly. Mina started off gently, sucking on the tip and the first few ridges. Slowly, with each bob of her head, she pressed further.  Evie gritted her teeth and pushed her hips forward, balling her hands into fists.");
	outputCodex("\n\nThe first few inches were easy enough, but Mina kept pushing herself to take it further.  She slid down until Evie’s tip bumped up against the back of her throat.  She paused there for a moment, leaned forward, and then plunged down over Evie’s shaft until her throat bulged out around it.  Mina’s hands stayed wrapped around the base of the shaft, pumping up and down, but there was less and less space to cover. Mina’s plump lips sucked up more of her shaft with each bob of her head.");

She came, hard. Her hips still jerked while her pink cum rolled down Mina’s throat.  Mina’s tight lips drew more out of her than she thought she had, until at last she was drained, slumped against the wall and gasping for breath.  It wasn’t quite the same as fucking a new host, but it left her spent and satisfied all the same.");
