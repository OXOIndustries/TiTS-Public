/*Furpies Simplex H/C/D
That’s Horse, Cat, and Dog, for those wondering.
Author: Fenpai Finally Noticed Meoxo

Notes:
Created by Dr. Badger to be spread extensively. 95% of all infections are asymptomatic, effectively creating “seeders” who don’t know what they’re doing to their partners.
Dormant infections activate after a period of five to ten years with the planned goal of creating the “furpocalypse.”
Virtually eliminated in the core, absolutely rampant on new rush worlds.
Symptoms:
Anyone with body fur is immune.
